There are lots of facilities that can be used. Eating places, 7/24 open study places, fitness. It is the best place to stay if you’re studying at BU.",Emre Demir
5 months ago,1,"When you lived in Uclub building. You must get suffered by the internet. It was lagging, the WiFi does not work normally. When you make a phone call to u club, they will let you call campus technology, when you call campus technology, they will let you wait, and just wait. You would never know what’s happen with the internet, and why it is lagging. The most terrible things is they would not help you to fixed it. Since this problems appear a month ago, and I still get suffered by it. Cannot playing any game and watch any video normally.",陈思睿
3 weeks ago,1,"I hate everything about this place. oven had no door for MONTHs. Every time we called maintenance they would “fix it,” the door would fall right back off and crush our feet as soon as it was used. thin walls, you will be woken up. Also, if you’re a busy person, you’ll never get your mail since you can only pick up 9-7. young, rude, and incompetent staff.",Shae Hassie
7 months ago,5,"This review is specifically for one of the people working at U Club. We had several issues with finalizing the lease for my daughter. The multiple issues had more to do with corporate than anything else. Throughout the entire process Izora was my point person and she was absolutely fabulous. Her customer service, personal attention and overall care were top shelf. I hope she would be recognized in some way because she is certainly deserving.",Ken Barer
8 months ago,1,"I don’t usually write reviews but every one star review about this place came to be true. It has been difficult from beginning to end with this place. They will find any possible way to charge you. This place was suppose to be a haven for students who enjoy the amenities provided for them but instead it became a headache and was definitely not worth it. If you have the option to live elsewhere, I would highly recommend doing so. The walls are paper thin and noise is definitely a problem which might keep you up at night. The managerial staff are just very nasty and not accommodating at all. I saw someone get charged 250$ for returning their key a few hours late. Ridiculous!",William Lin
6 months ago,1,"The management of this development is disgraceful.  It's actually a nice community with fine accommodations, but they take advantage of young people that feel disempowered.  My child had a lease through July 2022.  He left after school ended in May and before he could return to collect his belongings in July, the room was cleaned out.  To make a long story short, they offered a $40 gift card as compensation.  The Assistant General Manager, Caitlin Thompson, and the Area Manager, Kasandra Roberts, strong-armed a student to cover up the fact that they entered an apartment under lease and threw out all of the belongings stored there.  I have a long thread of emails showing their disregard for their actions and gaslighting a kid about what happened.  I recommend finding another place to live than U Club Binghamton.",Alan Heitner
6 months ago,1,"Don't live there you'll regret it. They try to scam you into paying endless fees and fake utility bills (which you have to pay or else they'll charge you late fees). The shuttle isn't running half the time and the staff is rude and useless. You're better off living in twin or literally anywhere else tbh. And i dont want anyone reaching out to me to speak to customer service. You guys should reach out to your own management specifically Aleesha Hunter. She is the rudest woman ive ever spoken to at Uclub (and i lived there for 3 years) and has zero customer service skills whatsoever. She was extremely rude to me and I don't appreciate that considering the fact that i was mannerly, polite, and professional towards. Idk who the hell she thinks is. Management should deal with her attitude and unprofessionalism. Also someone should teach her how to write a proper professional email with a heading while addressing customers needs properly. Jesus. She also tried to scam me into paying for a carpet stain that was there before I moved in and gave me attitude about it.",Kayla Deosaran
5 months ago,1,"EDIT: charged for not cleaning the stove when it was thoroughly cleaned. They provided a picture of the ""dirty"" stove in which the only parts that were noteworthy was the eroded paint on the bottom of the oven. Emailed them with this information to only be ignored twice. Uclub will do everything in its power to charge you for every last penny they can.

STAY AWAY FROM HERE. Walls are paper thin, so if you have a loud neighbor you will hear everything. I have been woken up numerous times at the dead of night by loud music even though I'm separated by one entire room from this neighbor (that room is empty, if someone actually lived there they would lose their mind). They have even woken me up at 3am during finals week. I have sent emails to the managers about the noise complaint and they don't even respond. This has been an ongoing problem for four months. It is not worth spending $900+ when you can't even get a good nights sleep.",Kelly Hu
7 months ago,1,"Look for incompetence in the dictionary, and Uclub Binghamton will show up. They'll charge you an arm and a leg for leaving a bag of green beans in the freezer, but when you put in a report of a defect they'll pretend they never saw it. I've called numerous times in the past about signing a 6 month lease(which they offer in limited stock) and they said that they don't do that here, then I called a few days later and apparently they were all sold out and that I would have to go on a waiting list behind 20 people all of a sudden, when just a few days ago they apparently didn't offer semester leases at all. I then asked if they could just allow one more 6 month lease for me, because they obviously don't sell all there apartments, and they would rather not fill the space than to lease it to me for 6 months. It's a shame because the place is nice, but management ruins it, and I'd honestly rather live in a shoe box as to not deal with their management.",Gianfranco Pulice
8 months ago,1,"Live at this place at your own risk! Their slogan ""you'll love it here"" is the biggest joke as the management does not have any regard for the students living there. Rent is extremely high, and for what?? For a pool that is only usable the last 2 weeks of the spring semester? A miniature gym with equipment that is constantly breaking down and always under repair? A golf simulator that is never used? And good luck negotiating with UClub if your apartment gets damaged due to circumstances out of your control. You are liable for everything that happens in the apartment whether it is actually your fault, and you can be sure that the entire up-charged cost of damages will be placed on you.  Don't bother fighting them because you will never win with them. For a living community that is supposed to be ""for students"" the management is only interested in getting as much money as possible from the tenants. They recently started charging for utilities and sewage, both of which never used to be included in the rent fee until the past 2 years, and become included as added fees in addition to the rent. Yes UClub is close to campus, but if you have a car, you have to pay for parking in addition to the campus parking fee. Furthermore, if you want to go downtown at night, the distance from campus couldn't be any further because there are no campus buses that stop at UClub to go downtown so you are left with taking Ubers, the costs of which skyrocket when you are trying to get home.

**To sum this all up, do NOT live here. If you want to live off campus, it is much less cheaper and much less of a hassle to find a house, or one of the apartment complexes, downtown.",Noah Mandelman
a year ago,2,"My daughter has been living in UClub apartment for 2 years. It’s nice that it’s mostly secure and clean. But what I don’t like is that the sidewalks are never shoveled or cleared of ice and snow! And the parking situation is ridiculous! I pay almost 900.00 per month for them to tell my daughter that she can not park in the lot without a parking sticker but when she asks for one, they “don’t have enough”! How do you NOT have enough parking stickers for all of your tenants?? We pay for an apartment that should include parking and she’s gotta worry about her vehicle being towed if she parks anywhere in the area. She recently had surgery and is unable to walk too far of a distance but she’s told she has No where to park!?! I will be contacting a lawyer if something happens to get out her vehicle!",Dusty Lanning
a year ago,2,It’s a pretty nice place to live and convenient but there are so many issues it almost seems not worth it. The shuttle they promised hardly runs and can often be late when it actually does. The WiFi just goes out with little explanation or support and those are just two of the various inconveniences that make it aggravating to live here. Update late to my class because the shuttle was sitting in the chipotle parking lot thanks for the heads up,Joey Flam
a year ago,5,"I’ve loved living here during my undergrad, it was an amazing experience with many memories i will cherish! The management was super helpful when I was hesitant about certain things and they walked it through with me very patiently. The maintenance was always expedient and friendly, never had any issues that lasted too long. Would definitely recommend to any students looking to live off campus!!",Jillian Smollar
11 months ago,1,"Rent is expensive, and many items in our apartment were broken or non-functional when we moved in. The place had not been cleaned at all prior to move in and still had crumbs, dirt, and cookware from the previous tenants. My toilet had old feces from a previous tenant in it when I moved in. One of my roommates found underwear from a previous tenant in his room. We're unable to see out of our windows as they're covered in mold. To top it off, there isn't guaranteed parking for those who purchase parking passes here. Just don't rent from UClub.

Edited to add: the parking situation is still horrible and current construction is extremely disruptive (will last through September, we were given 1 day notice before it started). Additionally, you cannot speak to management staff if you want to, they're never available.",Brad Estus
a year ago,5,"I love it here! Parking by the apartments is limited so sometimes I have to park near out behind the townhouses. Otherwise I have been very happy with my experiences living here, I signed up to live here next year as well since I love it so much! I don’t understand why there are so many negative comments, I have been very happy living here.",Alexander Umiker
7 months ago,1,The experience at this place is horrible. They will charge you an absurd amount for anything that happens to your apartment. Also I was having trouble paying rent on the resident portal for 3 weeks because of an issue on their end and was basically ignored the whole time. The management here are braindead so I don't recommend this place at all.,Ming Z
a year ago,5,"Visited the campus recently with my daughter.  We took a tour of the UClub facility and I must say I am very impressed.
Our tour was very friendly and informative.   The young lady that we met with was patient with an over protective dad and explained everything.   (From costs to roommates to parking and mail service).  I feel confident and safe moving my girl into these apartments.",Al Friend
a year ago,1,"DO NOT LIVE HERE!! This living community will do anything they can to make more money off of you. Despite charging more than almost any student housing in Binghamton,  UClub will find any opportunity to add more charges. The amenities that they claim to be the cause of their high rent prices are incredibly unreliable. The shuttle service would randomly be unavailable, half the study rooms were inaccessible and the pool was never open. The location is not convent because you are removed from the on campus and most of the off campus student life. The management staff will be unhelpful at even the most minor requests. And at the end of your lease no matter how meticulously you clean according to the directions they provide they will still make up any charge to make just a few more dollars off of you. They expect you not to question them but when you do they will admit that most of them are unfair and can be taken off.",Olivia R
a year ago,2,"I would rate higher if not for the fact that they were extremely difficult to work with regarding my refund. It took over two months to receive and I didn’t receive all of it due to a stain on the carpet that was there when I moved in (charge was not communicated to me until after I had to inquire about the missing money from the credit). It has been a frustrating process, nonetheless, and felt this poor experience was worth sharing.",Emily Culbert
a year ago,1,"Waste of money!! I paid so much for the extra services such as wifi and the bus to campus but recently none of those work properly, which creates extreme inconveniences. With such size, it is ridiculous how long it takes them to fix these things knowing students depend on this. Terrible management while continuously ADDING more fees to the monthly payment and DECREASING in quality, would give 0 star if I could",ttthre hng
a year ago,5,I would recommend living at Uclub to every BU student! There are so many great amenities that you have access to living here. I always took advantage of the study lounge which is open 24hours so it’s perfect for finals week. All of the staff at UClub are so friendly and willing to help. Any time i had a question or problem they responded right away. The staff put on a bunch of events all year round which are always a blast. If I could give this place 10 stars I would!,Maria Carlucci
5 years ago,1,"It is an understatement to say that Uclub has the worst management i have ever seen. Wish i could give this place a 0 star. When my sink wouldn't drain on arrival, they were extremely rude over the phone telling me that i needed to buy drain-o myself. Also, both the washing machine and elevator weren't working upon arrival either - so me and my 65 year old dad had to carry everything up 3 flights of stairs. They took a month to fix the elevator, and 3 weeks to fix my washing machine. Absolutely unacceptable. My view was of loud construction that started at 6am and went on all day, and my window was filled with dust - can't even imagine what i was breathing in all year. Parking here is a disaster, there are never any spots open. Adding insult to injury, if the rent is late by a day, they charge you a 50$ late fee, even if rent is due over a holiday (and mail may be delayed). They have no mercy with the late fees and will hound you for the money like hyenas - it is extremely unprofessional. And if you don't pay the late fee, they threaten you by saying they will report you to the credit bureau. They do not care about the tenant at all. Please, steer clear if you can at all costs.",Evan Margolis
5 years ago,1,"Management sucks. They are not able to inform you about your payment and deposit rights but really willing to charge you a fee when you're 3 days late to pay the rent. They are also rude and arrogant. Rooms are okay but too expensive for its service. Do not EVER EVER EVER consider to stay at here. They do not care  about fixing the broken things, cleaning of the common places. Just rent a room at the city center and pay half, have more comfort. They never inform you about your rights at all. I wish I was able to give a half or 0 star. Total disaster.",Gizem Kılıçarslan
a year ago,5,Great facilities and staff.   My girl is attending school here and uclub is the hands down choice for her housing.   We have seen no issues with staff during her stay and her and her roommates are looking forward to the covid restrictions being lifted to enjoy all the place offers.,Will R
2 years ago,1,"There are not enough words to express how much my roommates and I regret our decision to live at UClub Binghamton for two years. By the time we started experiencing issues we, sadly, already signed another lease and thus were trapped. The staff is usually friendly and helpful, with the exception of a select few front desk employees and the Assistant General Manager. Specifically, the Assistant General Manager has recently become more unprofessional and non-apologetic when it comes to tenants' concerns. Also, my roommates and I habitually experience appliance issues, including our oven that broke THREE times in one year. We are perpetually puzzled why we pay nearly $1,000/month for our oven to be repaired with duct tape (reference the attached photos). We believed UClub when they said that we were ""going to love it here"" and are disheartened by our experience. UClub has a lot of potential, if they updated the apartments and gave their staff more customer service training. Please, save yourself headaches and money by living someplace else.",Nia Brown-Fonrose
5 years ago,1,"For the price I could not be any more disappointed. Parking is a disaster as there is almost none available, and don't even consider parking in restaurant parking! After a 20 min stop inside my apartment I received a violation. I've already had problems with no hot water in the unit that took two days to fix. Cleaning done before move in was pathetic and I spent hours before unpacking trying to clean out webs, dust, hair and remove streaks, dirt, sticky substances, and old pasta from the floor and kitchen spaces. There is no soundproofing at all. You will hear every conversation that happens in the hall outside your apartment, and every car that hits the gas at 3am on Vestal. You will be calling maintenance and so far they've been extremely punctual and considerate. Staff in the office however, is not nearly as considerate or useful without a manager. Look elsewhere, it's not worth the price for all the inconveniences I've listed and others I've omitted.",Caroline Hissong
a year ago,1,Worst Place to live DO NOT LIVE HERE. I pay over $950 a month to live here and you arent allowed to use the hot tub nor the common area. My roomates and i so happened to get locked out one day and had to call a RA on duty to let us in and had to pay $40 to get back in. Not only do we pay an abusrd amount of money to live here but we have to deal with RUDE managers. Kasandra Stok is one of the general managers at U Club and she shoudlnt be able to interact with residents. Just over the fee and her interaction I will not be living here.,gigi p
5 years ago,1,"The amenities and environment are nice and all, but the management SUCKS. Student staffs there are usually nice and helpful, but the actual management are just cold and out there to make the most money from you.
They will treat you nice when you live there, but when you move out, they will try to take your deposit from the most ridiculous things ever, such as a piece of candy wrappers on the table for $20 or a puddle of water in the bathroom (from cleaning) for $30. I’m not making these up, it happened to me and my roommates.
And when I asked for the invoices that they claimed they “spend” on cleaning up my room, they refused to give it to me, because they did not hire anyone to do the cleaning, they made all the student staffs to do it, which costs them nearly nothing....",Y&D F
4 years ago,1,"I lived at uClub for 2 years and it was okay, but would not tell others to live there and my complaints are similar to those of others. TLDR: nice amenities for the most part...  BAD management... Not worth the price.
Bottom line..
Glad I finally don't have to live there anymore.
EDIT: 2 star went to 1 star as uClub is trying to scam more money as a work order that I was told would be fixed for FREE even when I had to submit it MULTIPLE times was never touched until two months later and barely fixed. They are charging us all for it.
Terrible.

First off, be aware your apartment will most likely not be clean as expected when you first move in... Mine was not and I heard the same from a lot of other residents. However, they expect your apartment to be spotless when you move out.
Now the amenities are nice.. study rooms, game room, the gym is great.. but in Phase 2. Yet, it's clear that Phase 1 (where I lived) was set to the back burner when Phase 2 opened. Most of the amenities are on Phase 2 side. Parking situation for Phase 2 seemed much better than Phase 1, it was almost impossible to find a parking spot if you came back after 8 pm. Printer in the Phase 1 study area is pretty much broken 98% of the time. Walls are thin, you can hear everything.

I also was not happy with management. They are very money hungry and clearly money is more important than the satisfaction of their residents. The student CA's do their best when they can, but are set to repeat what management want them to tell residents. The only employees I really liked were the maintenance guys, who are very nice and friendly.

I thought I had moved on, but got an email about having an outstanding balance on my account a month after I moved out when I had payed everything... Only stated in the email how long I had to pay them and how to pay. It didn't even state how much the balance was and what it was even for!... and can't even log into my account as I am no longer a residence to even see. Not the way I wanted to part uClub, but expected nothing less from them.",Robyn
2 years ago,5,"5 star from Billy! Came in to trade my phone. Called at&t, because it was close to closing time. Gentleman named Billy answered and he made sure he stayed late to assist me with the trade in on my broken phone. Young lady Stacia tried assisting me with screen protector, took almost an hour for her to do so, was not impressed with the protector and Billy informed me he would call the next to check in. I let him know I was impressed because it already had bubbles and marks, I came in and he put on liquid glass and I am beyond happy with my experience. Billy went above and beyond for me. I will continue to use this At&t store. I was considering switching to Verizon,  but Billy changed my mind quickly!!!!!!

Thank you for you excellent service Billy!",Alyssa Brace
a year ago,1,"DO NOT LIVE HERE. ive been here TWO MONTHS and already regret my choice. they will try to get ur money in any way they can. get this, apparantly we r “taking advantage” of the printer so now we have to bring our own paper if we want to print something at uclub. how dumb is that. we r students, what do u mean we r taking advantage? do u not realize we need to print things? i thought printing was one of ur amenities🤔 at least thats what ur tiktok video showed. oh and if u have a problem with anything, dont try to talk to the manager, shes always on a “lunch break”. yeah thats a joke. i could go on and on, but please save yourself the money and live somewhere else. me and my parents r fed up with the management",Alexandra Taylor
3 years ago,1,Taryn Jones the property/leasing manager is the nastiest and most unprofessional woman I have ever met. She cancelled my lease for the following school year with 2 weeks left in the current school year because they found someone to rent the apartment for the whole year at a higher monthly rent after I specifically asked for their help in finding a half year sublet. Then she had the gall to offer me a spot on the waitlist for housing so I could potentially get a spot after she gave mine away except now my rent would be much higher AND I would have to change units. Terrible management but the student CAs were as nice as they could be under such tyranny and maintenance staff was always super nice and helpful.,Laura I (Laura Iorio)
3 years ago,1,"Really poor service. Even if you resign your lease, prices get jacked up and you can't guarantee you'll even have the same room because they might relocate you.

4 years ago,2,"Uclub Binghamton is a good living environment. The club house is a great spot to hangout, the pool is nice, and the best part has to be having your own bathroom. However, the staff seems like they are discombobulated. The management it terrible and flat out rude. They are out to get your money, honestly, 800 should not be the rent price and the fact that they make you pay a “convenience” fee is ridiculous. Uclub is about their money and money only, management is rude/disrespectful/unconsiderable. Many benefits but damn, the negatives really make you mad when you going through it",Albert Odero
3 years ago,1,"Uclub Binghamton is such a scam!!! I would give them no stars if I could. They are overpriced and have so many hidden fees. For example, they advertise 24hr management support but neglect to mention that any issue that happens after hours is going to cost you. I paid around $35 to be let into my apartment because I was forgot my key and it was after their office closed.
They also tell people who are unsure that they can still sign a lease and if their situation changes just find someone else to take it over. What they neglect to mention is that the releasing fee is $250. They nickel and dime you every chance they get! And management is such a pain to deal with as they will continuously avoid any contact with residents with issues.",Kelsey Pruitt

Had problems since we moved in (flooding, floors peeling, etc) The new buildings (Phase 2) were rushed and built poorly.

Only benefits are the buses stopping all the time and the maintenance guys who are super nice.",Victoria
3 years ago,1,"I would give ZERO stars if I could! There are extremely unprofessional, wait until last minute to answer emails if they even answer. Their lease that they force you to sign without giving you a chance to make any amendments for yourself, or if you request a certain clause to be omitted or changed so that its not completely on me as a tenant if anything happens - they tell you basically ""take it or leave it"". it is completely unconscionable. They take away any tenant rights you may have and they tell you lies in order to think they are satisfying your requests when in reality they are just stealing your money! They make it impossible to terminate your lease, leaving you stuck with paying the full amount when I didn't even move in yet. MAKE SURE YOU READ EVERY SINGLE PAGE THEY GIVE YOU BEFORE YOU SIGN YOUR LIFE AWAY!

They claimed that you can live with your friends or select preferred roomates but its all FAKE, LIES. In addition to false promises, they make you pay a $250 fee for only a CHANCE of getting your preferred roommate; only to be denied soon after? What kind of ridiculous business practice are you running? Just because you can take advantage of desperate college students, doesn't mean its ethical! Horrible customer service, horrible response rate. Can't wait until this lease is done with so I can GTFO. Shame on you and your unprofessional and coercive business practices!

5 years ago,1,"These buildings are built horribly. Within just two months of living in phase 1, our AC was sparking, our water heater broke and needed to be replaced, the AC leaked and spilled into my roomate's room, and I had orange ooze coming from my bathroom wall which turned out to be a pipe leak (which I'm assuming meant mold as well, though they never gave me a straight answer despite pestering them about it). In regards to the broken pipe, my bathroom was locked for a full week and I had to go somewhere else to shower or use the bathroom, then for another week I had a 5 foot long hole in my room and was told I couldn't put my things in my bathroom. You never get warning on when maintenance is coming to your room either (didn't  know the day they were coming or the time, so I basically just avoided the apartment for two weeks straight because it's hard to study when people are constantly coming in and out / banging around).  I also have to leave my bathroom sink faucet on for about 5 minutes before getting hot water. I complained about this and they said ""sorry, that's just because you're in the furthest room from the water heater, nothing we can do about that.""

My friend lives in phase 2 (which was built last year) and their apartment got mold and they had to move out.

Parking is bad. They don't give out visitor parking passes, so if you have a friend visit they have to risk a parking ticket.

5 years ago,1,"Just moved in. The service is terrible. No one has answered my calls in 2 days and I havent had hot water in my apartment for several days. No one helped me move in, the elevator was broken and I had to get all my stuff up to the third floor. When I went to look for someone to get the elevator working I found 0 workers in all of phase 1. I can't believe UClub runs their business like this and on top of it it's way too expensive for what it is, especially phase 1.

EDIT: I moved in last September. It's January 31st and let me tell you, don't expect to be able to print here. It works sometimes but most often there's either no paper or the printers are broken. My ceiling also started leaking a month or two ago a few times. The issue is since resolved, but I'm still just as disappointed with this place.

Oh and parking is A.W.F.U.L. Definitely not even close to enough spots for my building. Also internet speed is sometimes even less than slow. And you hear every car accelerating at the light on Vestal Pkwy. The garbage trucks in the middle of the night are also hella loud.",Emily Christian
5 years ago,1,"They have been doing construction outside my window the past two weeks late at night to early in the morning. I've woken up at like 3am hearing drilling and trucks backing up. And the rent payment process can be confusing with the website they use. But we have an outdoor pool that nobody will be using the majority of the time we are here and lights up at night apparently, so I guess that's nice.",Liana
6 years ago,1,"This is the worst place to live in Binghamton as a student. The management here is nasty and fairly useless. The ""high speed internet"" could not be worse. It does not work nearly half of the day, and when it does work, it could not be slower. The free printing is utterly useless as the machine is frequently broken. Parking in UP is just a disaster. There are constant lot closures (even in the winter) which is truly unacceptable. A 10 minute walk from a parking lot is not acceptable. There is constant construction going on early in the morning which is loud and makes sleeping very difficult (6am start). If you have any other options, I highly suggest living somewhere else.",Aryeh Cooperman
3 years ago,5,"I was exploring the many options for off campus housing for this semester, UClub made the choice easy. This place is clean, friendly, and very close to campus with lots of things to do. Tony gave me my tour and was a rad guy who answered all of my questions and was very helpful. Can't wait to spend the rest of my time at Binghamton University living at UClub! Highly recommend to anyone.",Brandon Rinkavage
4 years ago,1,"U Club has some of the worst management I've ever heard of. The student employees are doing their best with little ability to help much, but the actual managers offer no help and find any possible way to avoid giving straight answers or assistance. More often than not, you're denied help and instead provided an email to reach out to, and there's 100% chance that the email for help will be completely ignored.
Management will often give you false information and give you very monotone apologies and standard explanations, a very straightforward ""I'm sorry about the inconvenience but I can do nothing,"" even when they directly caused the inconvenience with their own poor management.
When I signed the lease to live in U Club, most of the reviews said the management was horrible and I chose to ignore it because I assumed it couldn't be that bad. It really is that bad. Even when you follow all instructions and make a conscious effort to do nothing wrong, they will find a way to get you caught in a sticky situation, then admit that it was their fault, and then refuse to help you out of the situation despite them being the cause. Look out for yourself and take the reviews seriously, do not live here.",Andrew Daylor
4 years ago,2,Phase 2 apartments were poorly built and heating is a nightmare during the winter. Bottom floor will be 65 while the top floor is 85 because they put the heater in the attic. Big surprise: Heat rises. Walls are extremely thin. Would NOT recommend Phase 2 apartments!,Matt Teglash
5 years ago,1,"I pay $740 a month. Most of my friends live in other places pay 300-400. With such rent almost doubles the average in this area, the printer in the business center just cannot work almost all the time I want to use it.  How much does a new printer cost anyway? Maybe cheaper than the difference between 740 and 400?
Edited on Mar.28, 2018: I am not clear whether you had fixed it but it went down again, or you have not fixed it at all. But I just wanted to print something and found the printer ""print unable 2A""",Eric Zuo
4 years ago,1,"Should be ZERO STARS!  TOTAL DUMP! POOR MANAGEMENT! FLOODED APT!
My son’s room has had a huge leak that’s made the room unlivable for over one week! He’s been to the office, called, emailed, etc.  First attempt to fix it, required industrial fans running day and night to dry the saturated roof, making it  impossible to sleep or study/work in his room. He’s had to move his furniture out of the way to avoid water damage. Exterior wasn’t covered on interim basis, so water came back in after they removed industrial fans! Totally inept!

The building is new, so clearly the construction is poor.  With the roof, ceiling, and floor now all saturated, next will be the mold and mildew and stench that will soon follow.

Last night (week 2 of this nightmare) He FaceTimed me to show us the water POURING  into his room. Mgmt is collection $800 pp x 4 kids, $3200, which for Vestal is a lot of rent!  And you shouldn’t get a SLUMLORD for this kind of rent!  Seems like they take advantage of students inexperience dealing with slumlords to not fix a major problem. So now, have to spend my weekend on phone to their inept office staff to see if I can resolve the nightmare for my son.",Isabel Del Valle

•ridiculously overpriced for an apartment and they exhibit favoritism certain people pay less rent and have a deluxe
•matinence literally walks into your apartment unannounced and goes into rooms it happend to me on 3 occasions and even made a mess in my room
•There is no respect for tenants living there from management
•the walls are risiculously thin you can hear the person in the next room cough or sneeze and everything that goes on outside
•The hot water takes forever to come on you have to let it run for about 5 mins
•my toilet was broken and they took forever to come fix it

a week ago,1,"Good afternoon, I was parked (unaware) in the UClub Staff Parking to pick up my Corelife order. I was approached by an extremely rude woman by the name Caitlin who told me I couldn’t park there because it was “her spot” when she clearly had parked in the spot next to me. She proceeded to yell causing a scene and the Corelife staff came out to see what was going on. She proceeded to call towing services and tapping on my window, yelling “Bye” several times in a harassing manner and circling my car while calling to have me towed. By the time the towing services would have arrived I would have been gone anyways. As I sit here writing this review I’m currently sitting in your staff parking lot. 🤣 Maybe instead of Caitlin acting as a parking attendant maybe she should tend to the constant maintenance calls because obviously it’s an issue. You see, I work with students everyday and after that encounter, I will never refer students to rent from there if you have staff like Caitlin working there as management.
