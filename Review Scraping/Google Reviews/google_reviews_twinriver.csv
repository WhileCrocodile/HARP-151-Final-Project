The fire alarms definitely work üö®, the study rooms are nice to do work inüìö, and you can relieve some stress with a nice workout in the lobby gym. Maintenance is also conveniently easy to contact and Gavin always gets the job done well üî•.",graciela andrada
a month ago,4,"I've lived at twin now for almost 6 months, and I love it here! Safe parking, quiet apartments, friendly staff. It's easily the best student housing for Binghamton students. My only complaint would be the package parcel system that sometimes doesn't give you codes for your packages or loses packages. I would definitely recommend living here.",Jen Sallin
a month ago,5,Love TRC! Staff are super nice and always help with anything right away. The lobby/gym are awesome places to hang out and my apartment came in perfect condition when I moved in. Best place to live in Binghamton!,Brett Kerley
4 months ago,4,TRC staff has been super helpful and accommodating when situations occur. I have had some maintenance requests that needed to be fulfilled and they have been coming the same day or reaching out within 24 hours to let me know when they will be coming.,Danielle Horowitz
3 weeks ago,5,"Although I‚Äôm not a resident yet, the staff at TRC has been nothing but helpful already as I was getting ready to sign my lease. They would always contact me asking if I needed any help with my application, went over the lease agreement with me, and were super nice when giving a tour!",Sarah Hedvat
a month ago,4,"TRC is a great place to live in Downtown Bing! The apartments and bedrooms are a good size and the building amenities are great (BBQ‚Äôs in courtyard, full gym, Starbucks machine in lobby, private study rooms, etc)! The building staff are generally helpful when an issue arises and are very friendly when walking by the office. The on-premise parking is definitely convenient especially being there are limited parking options throughout Downtown Bing",Benjamin Klein
a month ago,5,Great place to live! Always quick to respond to work orders which is great! Just one issue: pleaseeeee put ac on in the gym its always so humid in there.,Erica Moore
a year ago,1,"I have lived at twin for almost a year now. I honestly have not been pleased with my experience so far, but I do see improvements happening. My main concern is that this place is NOT worth the amount we pay for rent. My unit has had numerous problems, including a flood that was left unresolved for weeks. Previous management did little to fix any issues, but the new management seems to be better. Furniture in the unit is pretty old. There have been issues with heating, water, etc. In addition, renovations have been happening throughout the building for nearly my entire time living here. I find it ridiculous that I am paying such a large amount of money for amenities that I can‚Äôt even use. Currently, we are unable to use the gym, lobby area, computer room, and cafe.
On the positive side, the new management seems to be an improvement, and the CAs are very helpful and do the best they can given the current situation, especially Dom and Sim. The maintenance team is great, especially Rob, Jeff, and Lucky.
My main suggestion to Twin would be to prioritize the current residents rather than future ones. Renovations are great, but not during the school year when our VERY steep rent is going towards things we cannot use and units that are not worth the price.",Malyssa Sadler
7 months ago,1,"This is my third year living at TRC and the quality of this apartment has gone down tremendously. I would not recommend TRC and I think you can find other places for significantly less. The building just got taken over by new management that only cares about profit and NOT residents. Wifi is awful here, there is no parking or building security (unlocked doors and gates), printing/technology amenities no longer work as promised, they don‚Äôt noise take noise complaints seriously, and we are now charged for package pickup. We no longer are offered cable and when the cable box was taken from our apartment they left the doors and lights on. One of my roommates was also interested in parking and she was told that she would most likely receive a parking pass but they said the lot is full when it‚Äôs clearly not. We are extremely disappointed in TRC and it‚Äôs new management and we hope that they fix these issues soon.",Charlotte Heo
a year ago,2,"I‚Äôve lived at Twin for about a year and a half, my experience has been neutral for the most part. The rent is extremely high for the amenities and quality of everything. There have been renovations all year, most of them were done poorly. They replaced the thermostat by covering the old one with a plate, ours was put on crooked, and then new one was randomly placed. They painted the hallways and one wall in the apartment, the paint job was done quickly and carelessly around the edges and doors. Management has always appeared careless, they seem to always have trouble connecting to higher ups which reflects poorly. There is always a money issue, whether being a refund check or getting your addendum properly added to the account. The appliances in the apartment are decent, the stove is old and doesn‚Äôt work properly. The wash and dryer are good, and a bonus is they are in your apartment. The dishwasher works well. The furniture is worn out and has holes or scratches. Nothing here is truly worth the amount of rent. However, some positives of living here are the CA‚Äôs, they are friendly and do all they can to help out. Maintenance is really quick and efficient, especially Jeff and Lucky!",Nikole Lockwood
11 months ago,1,Do you want promised or a newly renovated areas only taking a week or so to be dragged on forever? We‚Äôve been in renovations for 2 months now making common use areas useless. The wifi is atrocious. Never works properly. Trying to print something? Good luck. More than half the times it isn‚Äôt working. Worst of all is there gym. The equipment. Is in such poor shape and some needs to be replaced but they‚Äôll just slap a post it note over it saying it is ‚Äúout of service‚Äù. There was one machine that was out for more than two months in the fall. I definitely recommend staying away for the amount of money you pay.,Matthew Adamo
a year ago,4,"I lived at Twin River Commons for two years, and had a great experience. The staff are incredibly helpful, timely and friendly. The facilities are up-to-date, bright and always clean. Amenities abound both in the common areas and the apartment units. The staff occasionally host events, giving out delicious free food from local restaurants, and gifts throughout the year, including a special gift on your birthday!

The only problem I encountered, and the reason my rating is only 4/5 stars, was after move-out. Upon moving out, I received a ""light cleaning fee"", even after I left my room spotless. Luckily, I took photos of my living area prior to move-out, and argued the fee. The process took several months, calling and emailing multiple people, many not knowing what was going on, and some forgetting my case during follow-up even after I spoke with the same people prior.

Even with my move-out experience, I highly recommend Twin River Commons for student living. Piece of mind for security, great staff, clean facility, many amenities, beautiful units!",Ryan Lamberti
7 months ago,2,"My daughter and her roommate along with the entire building has had no wifi service for a month already.  She can‚Äôt complete homework, work on her computer or even relax and watch TV.  The entire complex has been complaining but nothing has been fixed  This is more then just an inconvenience.  Also the security gate has been unlocked along with the doors to access the building. I am extremely concerned and will not pay the next month rent if these issues are not resolved. This is not the first set of problems that she has experienced.  We are very disappointed!",Frances D'Aquino
a year ago,1,"I‚Äôm honestly really disappointed with Twin River Commons. I lived there for 2 years and absolutely loved my experience. But, when I moved out in August I was promised a security deposit refund. After about a month of waiting, I contacted the office manager Dalton who apologized for this and told me it was a ‚Äúchange in management issue‚Äù and that they would have access to my account shortly. Well, I waited another month and called back just to be told the exact same thing. Then after a few more months I called AGAIN and was promised by Dalton that he would try to overnight the check to me. I waited another month, and nothing! I called the office back and was in contact with another manager who apologized and told me he would personally handle the situation. He sent out an email to people hire up I assume, collected my email address and phone number and told me he‚Äôd contact me once he heard back. That was at least a month and a half ago‚Ä¶ I finally called the office back last week and asked to please speak to Dalton but I was told he stepped out of his office. The person on the phone asked for my phone number to be given a call back. I never received that phone call and I sent Dalton an email‚Ä¶ which he ignored, just like many other emails in the past about this matter! It‚Äôs now almost March making it just about 7 months since I moved out! This is honestly really ridiculous!",Eric Matusevich
a year ago,5,"Absolutely gorgeous place! Amazing staff and friendly resendents! Its been an absolute pleasure living here. Specifically, Dalton the head manager, is an amazing guy, he really helped me the process. Some other amazing staff which deserve recognition were Dominique and Xavier, just awesome guys.",Daniel Adler
11 months ago,5,Twin River Commons is truly the best student housing option in Binghamton. The facilities are new and beautifully renovated not to mention the staff is incredibly generous and helpful. This is an incredibly top notch community.,Sydney Sepp
a year ago,5,"I am a parent of a BU student and moved him in today. Wow, I felt like I was in a nice hotel. The facilities are beautiful and immaculately clean. The move in process was smooth as silk. They provide wagons to make the process easy.  Dalton the General Manager, was stationed at the front entrance to greet residents and their families. Overall I am very happy with my son‚Äôs decision to move here.",keith grover
a year ago,4,I would recommend living at twin! The location is incredible. I love that I can walk to local restaurants and also to see my friends downtown. Also they have in unit laundry which is incredible!,Sophia Sloves
2 years ago,5,"We moved our daughter in yesterday, we had never visited Twin River Commons so we were hoping for the best and were so thrilled with what we came across. More than anything else the helpful, knowledgeable and friendly staff was what we first encountered. Adam, who I think was one of the managers was so warm and helpful, Liz was so cheerful and kind, Dalton, the best, we had many conversations about logistics before the move, the awesome folks cleaning and preparing the apartment were so accommodating and kind and the woman in the office, we didn‚Äôt catch her name, but she was so helpful with our questions about parking. The facility was clean, organized and appeared very safe. Overall our first impression of Twin River exceeded our expectations. Thanks you guys and keep up the great work!!!",Michelle
a year ago,1,"Enjoyed living here a lot but my experience was ruined when the management neglected to give me a valid security deposit back. After moving out in August, I was sent a check in the mail which immediately bounced, so I contacted Dalton in the management office about the issue. It is now January and Dalton has promised to send me a new check twice, ignored my emails and phone calls, and somehow blames this issue on being ‚Äúbusy‚Äù and the ‚Äúnew ownership‚Äù. I have reached out to him personally at least a dozen times with no luck! Really bizarre and disappointing. Hopefully I will finally see my security deposit in February (after 6 months of waiting!!!!!)",Alina Young
a year ago,1,"I have had many issues with Twin River Commons, specifically Dalton Worgo. Over the past year and a half, I have had roommate problems involving smoking in the apartment, unusable kitchen and living room conditions, my TV was destroyed, and more. Dalton will rarely reply to emails and will only offer a meeting with you roommate as a solution. I am still waiting for my ‚ÄúRoommate Mediation Agreement‚Äù from Dalton when the meeting was over a week ago. I had to move out about a year into my two year lease due to deplorable conditions in my apartment. CLS Properties is no better. Jennifer Cooper with the head office will also ignore your emails. I am now forced to seek legal action against Twin River Commons. The only help I received was initiated by getting the Broome County Health Department involved.
Twin has also bounced security deposit checks on multiple people I know, which Dalton again ignored. Ignore any reviews on this place from two years or more ago. They had a different property manager and management company. This place is going down hill fast in management!
Food for thought, 20 Hawley Apartments are also owned by CLS Properties. Avoid both at all costs!",Thomas Rady
2 years ago,5,"Twin is a great living community for my daughter. They offer services that we were unable to find at other apartment complexes, and I can sleep well at night knowing that she is living in a safe and beautiful apartment.  The staff goes above and beyond, which makes every penny you spend absolutely worth it. We renewed our lease for 2021 and highly recommend that you do as well.",Todd Schmidt
3 years ago,5,"I lived in a house off campus my junior year and comparing my experiences I can confidently say moving into twin was one of the best decisions I made in college. I can finally feel safe where I live and have packages sent to me without worrying about them being stolen. It‚Äôs amazing having my own bathroom and a washer and dryer right outside my room. They also have a River walk in the back of the building that‚Äôs perfect for walking my dog. Best of all, the staff is amazing. They are so understanding and are willing to do anything to make sure you have a great experience here. If you bring up an issue they are very quick to resolve it. So excited for my second year living here. Definitely would recommend!",Sarah A

a year ago,5,"I absolutely love the open concept in the main living area ! It makes entertaining our group of friends so incredibly easy! The amenities here are fantastic, along with the amazing staff who are so incredibly eager to assist me when any problems have arose! I would 10/10 recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to live!",Paul Keen
a year ago,1,"It‚Äôs been a month of trying to get a hold of a solution from a manager about being charged $400 to replace a carpet that has two small ‚Äúburn and ink‚Äù stains that were not caused by my sister who lived there. My father who works in home improvement found it hard to believe that they would charge $400 to replace a WHOLE carpet over two small stains. My sister, who left 2 months before her lease ended to join the army, does not have stabile signal or time to call while training to dispute these charges therefore my father (her guarantor) and I have been trying to fix the issue on her behalf for a month now. My father has been receiving calls, emails, and letters in the mail from collecting agencies while these managers are still ‚Äúlooking into it.‚Äù In the beginning we were patient while waiting for updates but after several notifications from the collecting agencies, I would call the facility only to be told every time that a manger had stepped out and would reach back to me. I never received any such call whatsoever. In my earlier attempts to handle the issue, I called and a manager by the name of ‚ÄúDrew‚Äù (I recently have been informed that a manager of such name does not exist) tried to make a joke about a resident that lived there who was likable/ attractive but had an extremely messy apartment while saying that ‚Äúsometimes the people who seem neat and clean actually aren‚Äôt.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure if he was trying to make light of the situation but I found the ‚Äúmanager‚Äôs‚Äù comment to be to be very unprofessional as I just wanted to find a solution for the ongoing issue. I was present to help my sister organize her room when she moved in and saw that she had left the room in the same condition she found it when she moved out of the apartment. If you look at one of the other reviews, (like the one by John H) it seems like someone else had written about about having a similar experience with the additional charges after moving out of Twin River Commons. I speak on behalf of experience, please do a very thorough inspection on your own prior to moving in and report any minimal marks on the carpet or room, even if it may seem like nothing, because then you too will have to undergo all this to dispute a $400 stain that wasn‚Äôt even your fault. Even if you try to dispute the charges, it will be no use as it seems that getting a hold of room inspection histories is a challenge for the managers. Better yet, avoid similar issues a lot of us had here with this facility and consider other off campus housing choices. I do not recommend renting from here.
3/17- Update: After failing to be contacted about an update on the issue once again by one of the managers, Jordan, who had promised to reach out, my father's credit score had been affected negatively. I had mentioned several times to these managers, Dalton and Jordon, that my father and I wanted to resolve these issues before his credit score gets impacted since the collecting agencies had already started to contact him at the time. Although the damage was not left by my sister, my father paid $457.50 for the carpet replacement and cleaning fee. My sister and our mutual friends at Binghamton University, certainly do not plan to return to Twin River Commons in the future, especially now knowing what a hassle this experience has been.",Stefanie D.
3 years ago,5,I really enjoyed my experience at Twin Rivers. I lived there in my last two years of college and loved the close proximity to downtown and easy access to the bus stop to go to campus. There were nice amenities in the building such as gym and computer lab. My favorite part is hands down the in-unit washer and dryers though because most apartment complexes around the area would make you go all the way to the basement. I‚Äôd recommend Twin Rivers to any college upperclassmen who want to move off campus but still have access to convenient resources. Also dog friendly! üê∂,D L
3 years ago,5,"Twin Rivers became my home away from home. Starting over at a new school was already a huge adjustment, & being far from home added to my nerves. Even before moving in, the staff were extremely accommodating. I never had an issue getting in contact with someone if I ever had an issue. If I did, it was quickly resolved. The amenities are great for every student, and it‚Äôs in a perfect spot between Binghamton University and downtown. I realized early on the Twin River Commons staff were more like family to me, & I‚Äôm extremely thankful to have lived there while I attended school.",Alyssa Walrad
4 years ago,5,Twin Rivers is a wonderful safe place to live! I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and was sad to leave. The staff is friendly and approachable. I love the amenities. The gym is always maintained and clean. I cannot think of a better place to live while attending Binghamton University.,Andrew Verdon
a year ago,5,I love living at Twin! It‚Äôs a great building and the staff is really nice and helpful. Maintenance requests are also handled very quickly. I‚Äôd recommend this place to any student :),Lauren Petersen
3 years ago,5,"My experience at Twin River Commons has been wonderful for various reasons. The interior layout and design is of the highest quality in the Binghamton area; the cozy couches and tables, fire place, gym and game room promote meeting others and coming out of your room. The workers are friendly, helpful, and accessible; even if the office is closed there is a number you can call if you need assistance and a Community Assistant will be down to help within minutes. Twin is also pet friendly so there are plenty of dogs to play around with in the lobby. In regards to security, Twin makes me feel extremely safe with a gated parking area, and no entry to any doors in the building without a scanner, and a security guard always on watch. Twin River Commons actually won an award for being ranked in the top 1% of all student housing. So, if you are looking for student housing, Twin River is the way to go.",Matt Boccia
2 years ago,5,"Twin River is a nice alternative to campus housing.
As a parent,  was thrilled with the security/ safety aspect . The courtyard is charming.  The apt and rec area are clean. The people working there are friendlly and helpful. Makes me wish I was back in school!",Gerry Gaughan
a year ago,5,I love living here! The staff is great! I recently had an argument with my roommate that I thought couldn't be resolved. They came up with a quick solution that met both our needs.,Maggie Sherman
2 years ago,5,"Thanks to a super efficient and very friendly staff, we had an excellent move-in experience this past Saturday. Despite not being able to see the apartment ahead of time, it was just as beautiful as the pictures. We feel confident that our daughter is in a safe place. Best of luck to all.",Molly McLean
3 years ago,5,"I've lived at Twin River Commons for the past 6 months and I couldn't be happier with the amenities and friendly environment. Waffles for free every weekend, printing and top of the line computers to use, a study room on every floor which has come in VERY handy for group projects, and a wonderful staff. Every time I needed something fixed or tended to its been done within 24 hours by the maintenance team. Pet-friendly and super modern. I've loved my experience here.",Julia Steitz
2 years ago,5,"I've lived at Twin River Commons for about 3 months now, and I can't imagine living anywhere else. There is no other apartment complex in DT Bing that delivers the same service to its residents. I put a work order in for a light in my room and the maintenance team was there to fix it that same morning. They truly do go above and beyond to make sure we're happy, which makes the price so worth it. Especially when other properties have similar prices, but I know they don't have the same values. It is clear they value community here. The staff and the residents are all so friendly, which really makes it feel like a home. I've already renewed for next year, because I have no plans to leave anytime soon!",Lizz Schmidt
6 years ago,1,"It is very surprising to me that this place has so many good reviews because the only positive thing I would say about Twin River Commons is the amenities. The management is extremely rude, unfair and very unprofessional. Front desk continuously monitors you and have no respect for your privacy. I had an incident with one of my roommates and the whole staff from the managers to maintenance knew about it. I sincerely believe that the maintenance staff of a building should not know every detail about your personal life. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you hear the staff gossiping about the residents when you walk into the office. In addition, diversity is not valued here and they will make false accusations against you based on your racial profile. They have different standards for different races. They even disrespected my parents when they came to help me move out, we were all shocked because of the mistreatment. Overall, living here was a horrible and a very uncomfortable experience for me. As a matter of fact, none of my friends had good experiences. I certainly would not recommend living here, there are other student housing options downtown that has friendly and welcoming environments along with the respect for privacy.",Eyl√ºl Y
2 years ago,5,"If you are looking for off-campus housing, Twin River is the best place to be. As someone who has lived in other off-campus apartments, this place has the best ammendities, a closed parking lot, and most imporantly the best management. From previous experiences at Printing House - management makes a big difference in your living situations and people like Adam and Dalton will ensure you have the best experience at Twin River. A small tip I had learned from other off-campus housing, saving a little on rent comes back to bite you when you do your move out inspection. Twin River ensures you that as long as you properly fill out your move-in inspection form, maintain your room and request for maintaince services, the move-out inspection is seamless and you have no extra costs. The rooms are comfy, the location is unbeatable, the twin river management have montly events for the residents, lastly the wifi is reliable and great. My only regret about this facility was that I didn't come live here sooner.

Thank you to Twin River and the management for a unforgetable experience!",Karan Kat
a year ago,5,Lived here going on two years now and I honestly can‚Äôt think of any better place downtown. You truly get what you see!!  Don‚Äôt get me wrong though you sometimes run into the not so great roommates but with new management I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôll be a lot more on top of things.,Shamar Barker
a year ago,1,"Apartment was filthy when I moved in. Was covered in cat hair and remnants of the previous tenants' belongings... even rotting food left in the fridge. Twin had the audacity to charge me a cleaning fee when I moved out, despite the deplorable conditions I endured upon move-in. They will neither respond to email nor calls now to rectify this problem. The new management even deleted my account such that I can no longer access my lease.",Emily Ronan
3 years ago,5,"I absolutely love living here, the management is amazing!

Firstly, the manager Kenny is a great guy. Not only did he help me with any issues or question I had throughout the leasing process, but he was extremely patient and responsive at all times. Whenever I have an issue, I know that I can go down to the office - located in the lobby of the building - and let him know what is going on... AND I can be sure to have the issue resolved quickly.

Furthermore, Twin River Commons has an amazing system for submitting maintenance related issues and work orders.

I had the pleasure of meeting Adam, another individual who part of Twin River's management team. He is an incredibly handy guy, who has helped me with apartment related issues AND my own personal endeavors. I recently ordered a motor scooter and stripped a nail during assembly, which was stuck and I had no luck getting it out. On his own time, he came to my room and helped me work on my motor scooter -- getting the nail out and helping me further by aiding me in the installation of another part. Additionally, he marked and drilled holes in my licence plate so that I could screw it on to the back of my scooter. Without his help I wouldn't be able to ride it on the streets!

It is crystal clear that the management team at Twin River Commons not only cares about your experience living in their apartments, where they strive to provide the greatest customer experience and satisfaction for every student, but they also truly care about your overall happiness!

If you are convinced that you want to live in downtown Binghamton, look no further! I couldn't see myself living anywhere else.",Ziv Wand
3 years ago,5,"From the day I moved into Twin River Commons it already felt like home! Twin River Commons is extremely welcoming, their amenities and all they have to offer are unmatched. The second I stepped into my apartment I fell in love and every second living here as been so pleasant. If I ever had any concerns they were always addressed promptly. Another amazing aspect of Twin River is that it has gated parking, this is something that makes me feel much safer. Safety has never been a concern for me while living here. Overall, Twin River Commons is somewhere everyone should get the chance to live! My entire experience here has been nothing but amazing!!",Sophia Mele
8 years ago,4,Twin River Commons is a great place to live! The apartment was clean and prepared for move in and the maintenance staff is incredibly helpful. Its also really nice to be right next to a bus stop to get downtown. The only downsides of TRC is that the walls are very thin and you can hear people walking around upstairs and that there isn't enough spots in their parking lot for everyone,Leora Lyon
3 years ago,5,Twin is very nice apartment community in downtown Binghamton! Close to all downtown Binghamton has to offer but with none of the noise of living downtown. The apartments themselves are very nice and there are good amenities. The staff care about their residents and put on good events and are very helpful and accommodating when you ask them for help. Couldn't be more pleased with my housing choice this year!,Arsh M
3 years ago,5,I really like living at Twin River Commons. The apartments are really nice and modern. The furniture is really comfortable and I have cooked some great meals in the kitchen on the updated appliances. I would highly recommend Twin River to anyone considering student living in Binghamton.,Yami Reyes
3 years ago,5,My step-daughter currently lives at Twin River Commons and I could not be happier with our decision about her student housing. The staff is helpful and courteous. There are safety precautions in place to get in the parking lot and throughout the entire building which was key in our decision making. Thank you Twin River!,Mary Ellen Hurley
2 years ago,5,"I moved here from Hawley after my junior year and do not have enough good things to say about the people who work here and just the overall environment. Everyone is SUPER friendly and receptive to any issues that might come up or really any requests at all. After coming from Hawley which felt extremely cold, had no sense of community, laundry machines were always broken, printers were always broken and staff members were not friendly, Twin could not be any more different - the people here are so kind, the staff jump at any opportunity to help out, things get fixed quick. I always feel comforted when I walk into the building after dark and a security guard is watching video footage to make sure the building and the parking lot are safe. One of my absolute favorite parts of twin are all of the events that they put on for the residents. They are ALWAYS giving free stuff away!! On Super bowl they have tons of catered food, during finals week they give away free Starbucks coffee/hot chocolate from the machines and have a ton of free de-stressing events like local Binghamton yoga coming in, Valentines Day treats, free Dominos pizza, Parade Day treats, free waffles on the weekends... the list goes on and on. After reading some of the reviews residents left that weren't super flattering I wanted to set the record straight - people might get stuck with crazy roommates that they don't like or maybe students are loud and having too much fun/enjoying themselves too much in the courtyard (like students are supposed to be doing??), but at the end of the day I can tell you its the people that make the difference. I love following the Twin instagram account and staying up-to-day on everything. They have dogs walking through the lobby all the time that act as communal therapy dogs. I'm staying here for a second year for grad school and cannot wait. One of my roommates is staying here for her third year. You don't see repeat customers like this unless they are doing a good job. With so many downtown Binghamton apartment options Twin is the best by far. I have had friends at Chenango, Printing House, Uclub, random apts, off campus houses, and can confidently say that Twin by far exceeds all other options.",Cailyn O'Shea

2 years ago,5,"Our experience at Twin River Commons has been exceptional.  Our daughter lived at Twin River her Junior and Senior years while attending Binghamton University.  The staff was always responsive.  When she created a work order for facilities, they addressed it within a day.  Security is top notch.  All doors are locked and even movement within the common areas requires a key fob.  We were very pleased with our interactions with one of the managers on staff, Ken Fox.  Our daughter graduated early so we had to relet the apartment for the last six months of the lease.  Ken walked us through the process and made it easy to complete.  We would highly recommend Twin River Commons for off-campus housing.",Joe DeMarco

2 years ago,1,I would not recommend TWIN RIVER COMMONS for your student to live in. My Daughter rented there for the 2019 school year. As we all know the Pandemic struck in March. The gym and office closed. They did not credit us for the lack of amenities. That was understandable. My daughter moved out and left the apt in spotless condition! They billed us for an extra cleaning - as they said she didnt leave it clean! They wanted photos which she didnt take at the time. SO now they are ripping off poor college students for the cleaning! There are other places in town that would NEVER do that. SHAME ON THEM,Sandra Gerber

a year ago,1,"Make sure to get a copy of the lease before setting your heart on this place.  They have more ""fees"" than you can shake a stick at.  Also made the mistake of paying with a credit card which has a $30+ ""convenience fee"" for each rent transaction - outrageous!  When I saw that I tried to switch that first month to e-check auto-pay and they would not reverse the charge and take an e-check.  Once they have your money, it's gone",J Cam
3 years ago,5,Twin is the best place to live in Binghamton! I've lived here for the past few months and I love everything about it. The location is perfect for classes in the Downtown Center. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. I'm so happy I chose to live here!,Nicole H
6 years ago,2,"If you are here for just the apartments then it is a great place. Sadly I cannot say the same about the management. I was a sublet for the summer and before signing the lease the employee behind the front desk explicitly told me that the parking would be free for the summer as the place is almost empty during summer. All I needed to do was buzz at the gate during office hours and they would let me in. Fast forward 1 week into the lease when I tried to buzz in the lady at the front desk called me to the office. They were extremely rude to me about the entire incident and almost blamed indirectly for lying about what had been said. Obviously customer is always right does not work here. When I lost my fob another employee at the front desk was extremely rude about getting me a new key and acted like she was doing me a favor helping me out. The girl I subletted from told me that she has worse experiences with them but obviously after I had signed the lease. Thankfully I had to stay there only for 2 months of summer.

Overall the experience was awful because of the managing staff. They were rude and hostile. I suggest staying anywhere else but here for the kind of rent they charge.",Falguni Sood
11 months ago,3,The place is nice and the amenities were great until the started doing renovations halfway through the year and got rid of most of them. Rents pretty high too but it‚Äôs comparable to similar places and is in a great location.,Andrea Russo
2 years ago,5,"Twin is the best off campus option for Bing students by far. What separates them from other places has to be their staff. Super friendly, always willing to help, and makes you feel at home. The safety of Twin can‚Äôt be beat either",Justin Long
2 years ago,5,"I already wrote a review but i wanted to write another one after living here for 3 months in regards to this building's staff and service. top notch- door to door mail delivery, prompt maintenance service, and an overall pleasant experience. it wasn't until i lived here did i realize its superiority over every other building in downtown Binghamton",Hymie Bildirici

3 years ago,5,My experience here has been great! The staff is so friendly and there are so many amenities available to residents. The apartments are nice and roomy. And it‚Äôs such a convenient location since it‚Äôs so close to the bus stop. Would definitely recommend living here!,Vicky Ouyang
3 years ago,5,"I have lived here for 3 years. I am so grateful to live at Twin River Commons. It's right in the heart of downtown, right next to a bus stop and all my downtown classes. Nice kitchens, in-room laundry, and I GET MY OWN BATHROOM. There's a gym, a tanning salon, a game room, outdoor grills, a computer lab, study rooms, resident parking, and more. Every room is a suite-style setup. It's very safe and secure.

The staff is very friendly and professional, from the managers to the student assistants to maintenance to the custodial staff. Adam and Patty are my favorite non-management staff workers. You get to form good relationships with people here. All the staff know your name and can usually just give you your packages without you needing to remind them your room number.

My favorite part about living in TRC is the management. Kenny and Coleen have helped me so much during my time here. I had a nightmare roommate situation this year (as happens sometimes when people's personalities clash), and they bent over backwards to support us in any way they could.

Kenny is a rare type of manager. He does his job because he actually cares about the well-being of students, not just because we're paying rent. In fact, I'm graduating this semester. He very well could have told me to just deal with my hell of a roommate situation until I graduate, but he didn't. He met with us many times and played mediator. He was very patient and accommodating. He went above and beyond when he didn't have to. He wants us to be happy, not simply pacified. That sort of attitude alone is worth the price of living at TRC.

I highly recommend TRC to students who are looking for upscale housing in the downtown Binghamton area. There may be cheaper and less glamorous options, but you can't put a price on hospitality.

Did I mention I have my own bathroom?! :)",EB DB
4 years ago,5,"The staff and maintenance team are amazing and so nice. The large computer room with unlimited printing, both Mac and Windows OS, is a huge plus. Not even a block from the OCC bus stop and downtown BU classes. Study rooms on each floor with flat screens and printers as well. Gorgeous  downstairs, Starbucks coffee, LARGE arcade, beautifully manicured courtyard with grills and outdoor luxury seating--WHAT else COULD A STUDENT ASK FOR?! I Absolutely love this place.",Christie H

Re-signed for next year without any hesitation.",Shelby Hochberg
3 years ago,5,"Kenneth is coolest guy in the office. He helped to get my driving license twice, listened all my complains, and solved any problems I had whole year. The place is little expensive when you compare overall housing in Binghamton, but it is definitely the best quality in the city and have a great river scenery. It located 2 min to the bars and restaurants. The only downside is the windows in the gym. They can't be opened, it is hard to breathe inside.",shortcrypto

4 years ago,2,"Twin River Commons is a nice place, in which the buildings are well maintained, however the customer service by the staff is horrible. The management at Twin River Commons has a habit of adding on additional charges when moving out and when contested, they fail to speak about the fabricated charges and send e mails threatening to instill late fees that could affect one's credit report. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TWIN RIVER COMMONS.",john h

10 years ago,2,"i have lived here for 6 month's now this is a real review rather then a review by someone when the place was not open yet. this place is not worth the money. parents pay 850 a month for a over priced small bedroom and shared living room and a medium sized bathroom. the tennets are all student's who go drinking every weekend and romp through the halls yelling and screaming. the security staff is a joke at night. a guy walking around who wont do anything. the internet constantly drops and the water is discsusting its so cloudy i actually used it for a class project in biology and got a A. now for the best stuff, 1. there is not enough parking spaces for you and never will be. if there is anything going on at the arena the rednecks take all the street side parking and your left running around walking forever just to get home. as for the computer lab that place is always broken down, printers dont work, computers are down. this place is just a over priced polished turd hoping to draw students and parents in because its alittle cheaper then hawley street and it isnt in the neiborhoods around here which are not as safe as they use to be. trust me on this moms,dads, students. this place is way to over priced and you wont get any sleep and the water will actually make you sick and get you a A in biology. thanks",Christopher Weiss
10 years ago,2,"NOISY! If you want to sleep before 3 am DO NOT move here. Even if a person goes down to the management office to have them do something, the person is simply told to try and deal with the noise themselves. Every weekend since BEFORE the semester started I have been forced to stay awake until morning as my room was literally shaking due to the high volume of the music and yelling/screaming below AND above me. (I have even slept in the computer lounge since it was quieter there than in my room). Besides this and the frequent fire alarms going off (which is understandable with a bunch of drunk idiotic college students trying their pathetic best to cook something, probably for the first time in their lives) TRC is not that bad a place to live. So if you plan to SLEEP at TRC, find another place to live.",Monica Countryman
