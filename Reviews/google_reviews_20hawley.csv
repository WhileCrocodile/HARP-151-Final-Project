6 months ago,5,First year here at Hawley and I am so far loving the experience. I lived on campus for the last two years and this is such a better living situation. Being right downtown and having the parking situation we have here is just amazing. I also love the rooms and being able to walk to good restaurants instead of having to order it online. Also I have seen some comments about management not being the best but I just want to say that anytime I have had an issue it has been fixed right after I raised attention to it.,Eamon Dillon
3 months ago,5,"20Hawley is one of the best places to live in downtown Binghamton. They have the kindest and most accommodating staff. They always want their residents to feel safe and happy in their living space. It is a great space for graduate and undergraduate students. The building feels luxury and classy, which I love. The amenities are great and they  keep the building clean which is very important. Living here is like living at home away from home. I highly recommend 20Hawley, 20/10! No need to think twice!",Brianna Pappas
6 months ago,5,"It’s a modern, exquisite looking building with a stunning view of downtown Binghamton from the inside. It’s a great building with many nice amenities and a friendly staff. I was very delighted to have met Noel Smith. He is a genuine, down-to-earth guy who is very helpful and made arranging my stay at 20 Hawley for next year a trouble-free. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an apartment to stay at in the area!",Matthew Glick
6 months ago,5,"Not only is it located in the most convenient part of of downtown Binghamton with access to some of the hottest restaurants and the bus stop, but the amenities provide all you could ask for.

3 months ago,5,20Hawley is the best place to live for undergrad and graduate students at Binghamton! It is such a nice off-campus living space and the staff is so welcoming and helpful! It feels like family here. I have been living at 20hawley for 2 years in my undergrad and it has seriously the best decision I made! The staff is very on top of accommodating their residents and it shows!,Alexis Pappas
6 months ago,5,Absolutely stunning apartment building. I could live in just the lobby and be completely satisfied for the year. Management has always taken care of me and I have experienced no speed bumps in my 2nd year living here. Highly recommend over other student housing downtown.,Ismail Lahbichi

a year ago,5,"If you’re on the fence about where to live in Binghamton, choose 20 Hawley! From the spacious and comfortable study rooms, to the free gym downstairs, and most importantly the amazing staff that makes Hawley feel like home away from home, the place is amazing. The rooms are spacious and have great views of Binghamton. Not to mention it’s a great location in the heart of downtown Binghamton. There is underground parking so you don’t have to shovel out your car in the winter. Fit Kitchen is right next door and they’re building a Beer Tree adjacent to 20Hawley. Besides the sensitive fire alarms, (at least we know they work!) I have really loved my 2 years living at 20 Hawley.",Kayla McKiernan
8 months ago,5,"Living at 20 Hawley St. was great, the location was safe and easy to walk to other places downtown, the staff was easy to contact, free coffee and free laundry, newly renovated common areas that were gorgeous. Their prices are reasonable, you get a lot for your money and it doesn’t feel like they’re trying to rip you off in any way shape or form which I can’t say rang true for my other apartments of the past.  I definitely recommend for living off campus.",Caitlin Migliore

6 months ago,5,"After spending time at 20 Hawley, it is evident that the management and maintenance staff work cohesively to provide an unsurpassed level of service to their clients and prospects. In the office Noel, James, and Eric all take the time to do the most they can for every resident. On the maintenance and facilities side of the operation, you would hardly ever know they're there. The building is clean and kept in the upmost condition while have a minimal impact on resident's living. Steve and Dave especially act in an extremely professional manner as they help resolve issues of all different scales. They complete quality work in a timely manner and inform residents of any must know information. From the elegant and classy lobby, to the well thought out preventative maintenance plans, the staff works to make your stay a comfortable, exciting, and most importantly safe one. 20 Hawley is a prime example of quality living in a great location. If you enjoy going out into the downtown area, it is a quick walk to the local restaurants and other entertainment. The property really stands out from other competition with the extra amenities offered such as, complementary laundry detergent, regular community building events, a well-maintained gym with free weights, a squat rack, and a security guard that patrols into the late evening hours.",Thomas Szajkowski

6 months ago,5,"Easily the best housing in all of Binghamton. On top of the endless amenities, Hawley is very well managed and maintained. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to rent downtown.",Aidan Milroy
5 years ago,4,"I've lived here for 4 months now and I can say I am pretty pleased. Issues I've had are the lack of care when it comes to obnoxious parties and the stench of Marijuana down the halls. The brand of ""Luxury"" is just about the security and semi- updated applicances. The views are great and the amenities are there when you have company. Would have liked to see a larger activity such as a Basketball court or a full size pool but I know there may be restrictions and liabilities.",Decker Ayers
6 months ago,5,"Man this place is so good. It is so well ran and everyone is so pleasant. It has everything you could ever need. For the price, this place is perfect for anyone. Everything is so accessible and the gym just makes it so much better. 10/10 recommend.",Nick Padagus

a year ago,5,"Seriously love Hawley. Gym is great, staff is helpful and accommodating, and maintenance is always quick. Very at home feeling while keeping a modern look. Noelle, the LM, is great. He knew my name within the first 3 days of living there. Amenities as a whole are amazing and I find stuff I didn’t even know about every week. Great location downtown too and I always feel safe.",Matthew Kalaf
2 years ago,5,"This is my second year living at 20 Hawley and I love it. The staff is so kind with any concerns or questions and really get to know their residents. The lobby is beautifully redone with a great gym and study rooms that I have used almost everyday. The apartments itself is amazing with great working appliances, spacious bedrooms, and personal bathrooms. The maintenance team is also great at attending to work orders. I have had a great experience here and would definitely recommend to Bing students!",Jamie DeTingo

a year ago,5,"I haven't moved in yet but the customer service surpasses that of apple and discover. They are diligent, caring and responsive. Shout out to Eric, James and the Supervisor--- I didn't get his name, but they were all so lovely. I can't wait to move in.

I visited the property once and it was lovely. State of the art appliances and services. Gym, laundry room, nice but simple apartment furniture and layout, Starbucks coffee, pool, fire pit, parking, and its so close to everything.",Keeara Treleven

a year ago,5,"20Hawley is the place to be!! I started living here over a month ago and could not be happier with my experience!! The staff here is fantastic and super welcoming. The leasing manager, Noelle, is so beyond kind and shows much care towards the residents. He is professional, helpful with EVERYTHING, and is honestly just an amazing person. He helped me find my roommates and did a FANTASTIC job; I could not be happier with my roommates. Additionally, events are often organized for the residents, which is great because they encourage you to interact with the 20Hawley team and fellow residents, which I love! I highly recommend 20Hawley!!",Brianna Pappas
a year ago,5,"20 Hawley is a great place for student housing!! The staff here is amazing and they truly care about your living experience! They frequently have fun and interactive events for the residents which is cool! The maintenance team is also very sweet and accommodating! Whenever you need something fixed, they will help you without a doubt!",Alexis Pappas
10 months ago,1,"Non-responsive management! Absolutely no respect shown from anyone from their management! There were many issues during the year when my daughter was renting the apartment. Basic repairs were never made. My daughter's ventilation system - air-conditioning has not worked since she has moved to that apartment. She has complained many times, no repairs were ever made. Of course she couldn't open her windows so no normal air or temperature was in her room. During pandemic, management was even wiling to remove any fees from the lease despite that the building was empty, that parking lot was not used. GYM was closed most of the time after the pandemic. The laundry machines were not working at all. Half of the time her things were just damaged because she had to dry them for hours. Management really didn't care much, just was making promises or giving BS statements. I strongly suggest that parents look into other apartment complexes in the area. Plus carefully read the lease agreements, and verify all of the bogus fees that they just include in the lease. They are not reducing anything despite unused apartments, parking lots, when there was water break, and two days there was no electivity. This one looks great on the outside and the sales people pitch a great story. But, you will be sorry if anything ever goes wrong. They DO NOT show any respect neither to the students who are the renters or to their parents!",Yelena Kotlyar
2 years ago,5,"Living here has been an awesome experience! Units are well-maintained, with up-to-date appliances. Great amenities - including a newly renovated lobby, gym, and coffee bar. Use of washers/dryers is free. Staff is always very accommodating. The location is a major plus too - walking distance to a lot of great restaurants in downtown Binghamton.",Rich W
a year ago,5,"Great staff, responsive, and almost always available. Only had one problem needing maintenance and was resolved pretty promptly. Noel is a great guy who gets things done and goes out of his way to help residents. Would recommend to any Bing student looking to live downtown in a nicer building/area.",Sri Drishaal Kumar
a year ago,1,"Just another college apartment building that doesn't treat their tenants as paying customers -- rather as replaceable cash crops.
The building staff is apparently trained by Forbes (and while some staff is extremely professional), a few are simply shocking.
The coffee machine never has cups, the laundry room is always flooded/full, and the fire alarm goes off nearly twice a week. All of this of course is hidden during your tour of the building.
20 Hawley also supports the Colonial Restaurant -- google their story if you'd like.
Finally, I've heard the staff call binghamton students idiots that ""need saving"" when they get drunk.",Ellie Pliskin
a year ago,5,"Hawley has great amenities. I love the study rooms on the 6th and 7th floor, a great and quiet place to study. The maintenance workers are extremely kind and really get to know you! The staff always knows how to get their residents involved and plans fun events like hawley heist!",Kayla Giarriputo
a year ago,5,"Great facility that holds amazing events like the eastern staffing this weekend. Amazing staff and just gorgeous in general, the lobby looks like a hotel.
You are around many stores, shops, and food within walking vicinity which is perfect for those that don’t have cars.
I look forward to living here next school year! With all the amenities the cost is more than worth it.",Jillian F
6 months ago,5,Truly a once in a lifetime experience. Hawley is first on my recommendation list when people ask for downtown living in Binghamton.,Steven Donofrio
2 years ago,4,Incredible place to live! Staff was comforting and welcoming and able to deal with problems immediately. The Roof deck lounge was always open rain or shine for whatever festivities you can imagine. The deluxe spa out back is perfect for romantic getaways into the early morning. The rooms were fitted with premium furniture and appliances that never failed or required maintenance.,tanner kurtul
6 months ago,5,"I have not actually lived here yet, however the building is truly a piece of art. They have all the accommodations you need and everything from the lobby, to the gym, to the patio, to the rooms are very luxurious and high class.

2 years ago,5,"Living here at 20 Hawley Street is going great. As I'm writing this review, I've been here for a week and it's been great so far. Move in day was easy and straightforward, thankfully because I'm a  transfer student. The building was clean and the  process was overall trouble-free. They had carts ready and available for people moving all their things.  Following move in day, everything has been fantastic and I'm looking forward to the rest of my time here. The staff has been extremely kind, helpful, and friendly to someone who is completely new to Binghamton as a whole. I would definitely recommend anyone looking to  move here to take a tour of 20 Hawley.",Garrett Fitzgerald-Lubin
2 years ago,5,"20 Hawley Street is a great place to live! The apartments are big and and each room has the perfect amount of space.

My friends and I all renewed our leases :) The location is also very convenient and close to restaurants, night life, and the Binghamton U downtown center where I take classes.",Saya Patel
a year ago,5,The maintenance team in the building is amazing. They go above and beyond to fix something. The AC in my unit had an issue and the same day that I notified the office it was taken care of. I always know that if there’s something happening in my apartment that I can’t take care of myself there will be someone in the complex happy to help me solve the issue. Thanks again Dave!,anne-lise torres
2 years ago,5,"Noel Smith is the most helpful and kind employee at 20 Hawley. He has helped me manage switching apartments within the building, finding someone to relet my apartment, and has been so patient with me and my family as we raise questions and concerns. He has never made me feel like a bother and is always willing to work around the clock to make sure his residents are happy, safe, and comfortable. He is constantly in communication with me about any progress made and finds a solution to every potential issue before it even arises. I am so grateful for all his help throughout the past few months and I can't thank him enough!!!! You are the best Noel :)",Sophia Cavalluzzi

highly recommend this building very luxurious and they care about their tenants.  NOEL you rock.... Jennifer cooper is the regional manager is is great too!!!!! if you are considering moving in highly recommended.........:)",tali klebanow
2 years ago,2,"It’s nice and fancy, however things are always broken. I had to wait over a month to get a leaky sink fixed, the laundry room is always full because half of the washers and dryers are broken. The intercom system and the elevators are always “under repair”, the hot tub has never been functional in 2 years of being there, the grills are disgusting, and there are only 2 tiny study rooms open, the rest are locked. Overall, I love my apartment I just get frustrated that all the amenities are restricted or broken. Steve the maintenance worker and Shu are THE best workers there, they deserve the world. Also, all of these reviews are biased because the leasing office gives away gifts if you leave reviews. Be careful when considering here, IT IS VERY NICE and your apartment and room are nice, just the extras you pay for are iffy. Sad because I love the “nice” look and my apartment but I won’t be renewing because it isn’t worth my money until things get fixed.",Paige Cummings
3 years ago,5,"Visited 20 Hawley Street and took a tour. Property is nice! The manager, James was very welcoming. I am an out of state student so, the little things matter.A friendly face goes a long way. I'll be signing a lease soon!",The Spoiled Coach

6 years ago,4,"The staff was very friendly, and always eager to help with anything. Apartments are cozy, but spacious. Numerous amenities (hot tub, computer lab) add to the appeal of the modern-looking building and the prices are within the range of any student. Overall, I had a nice experience living there.",Ethan Palamaro
3 years ago,5,"I'm not from Binghamton and I don't live in NY but I actually had the pleasure of visiting 20 Hawley to see a family member and I was blown away!!!

The staff was professional and the building was beautiful!  I had the pleasure of getting a tour from the general manager James and I was really impressed.  The way everyone interacted and the amenities they have on site are great. I was also inpressed with the size of the two bedroom floor plan and would definitely recommend this apartment if you are a student or need a place to live in downtown Binghamton!

Cant wait to visit again.",Philana Ware
2 years ago,1,"Management is incompetent and typically rude. They don't care about residents, they only care about people looking to sign a new lease. You can't open a single window in the entire building. You would think they would invest in 1 window per apartment that can open but no such luck. Overall, I would recommend Twin River Commons over Hawley because of apartment space, size, window-opening ability, management, and style.",Paul Henry

3 years ago,5,"Living at 20 Hawley is truly amazing.  Amenities are top-notch and the staff is always kind, willing to help, and they do everything in their power to make your living experience a luxury. Shu helps me with any questions I have, makes getting packages super easy, and is very accomodating. 20 Hawley is a prime downtown location. It is across the street from the UDC bus stop and near all the best restaurants you can find in Binghamton. It is extremely convenient and totally worth the price. I always feel safe and comfortable when I'm in the building.  I have no complaints.",Grace Miou
6 months ago,5,Made my time in Binghamton amazing. Would recommend this place to everyone,Dylan DeMasi
4 years ago,2,"20 Hawley isn’t a bad place to live, however there are numerous issues to be wary of before you sign a lease. To start, the fire alarm indiscriminately goes off at least once a week. This is because when a person trips the smoke detector in their bedroom, it sets off the alarm for the entire building, which really sucks if it’s 5 am and you’re trying to sleep. The fire alarm system is flawed and the staff are currently trying to make the false alarms less prevalent, but from my understanding this has been a problem for many years now and there will still be false alarms fairly often. In the two months I’ve lived in Hawley, the alarm has gone off over 20 times, which has been very frustrating for me. Another big problem with Hawley is that the windows don’t open at all. Although the windows are big, they don’t open, which makes ventilating out cooking fumes and getting fresh air next to impossible. Another issue with Hawley is the quality of the apartments. When I moved into my 5 person unit, the walls, ceiling, and floor were dirty. Much of the furniture we received was also damaged, and the refrigerator was also dented up pretty bad. The floor is also cut up and damaged in many places. Surely not all of the units will be as bad as mine, but it would have been nice if they cleaned up the place better and replaced the floor and furniture before my friends and I moved in. Another thing to mention is the quality of the appliances. The oven takes forever to preheat and cook food, the microwave isn’t nearly powerful enough, and the refrigerator even on the coldest setting isn’t that cold. 20 Hawley claims to have “luxury apartments”, but I wouldn’t apply that term to the apartment I received. Another problem I have with Hawley is that their printer is old and breaks often. I print very often and it’s very frustrating when I have to spend 15 minutes trying to get the thing to work. I have been told that management is currently in the process of getting a new printer, but they should really have replaced it long ago when it started breaking. The rent at 20 Hawley can be upwards of 1000 dollars a month, and for that kind of money I expected a pristine apartment with proper amenities. I believe that many of these problems stem from the fact that whoever owns the apartment building doesn’t take enough initiative to improve their building and they don’t provide the staff with the resources they need to address the prevailing problems I have mentioned. Although Hawley has a lot of problems, many of which I haven’t even mentioned, there are of course some upsides. The location on Hawley street in downtown Binghamton is very good since you’re close to everything that matters downtown. Hawley also offers underground parking which is convenient, however you do pay extra for it and the garage is very treacherous to navigate. I, along with many people I know have scraped up their cars trying to squeeze around the tight corners in the garage. Perhaps the best thing about Hawley is their staff. The maintenance people and custodians are very friendly, and the people at the front desk are helpful. The managers will go out of their way to help you solve any problems you may have and they are pleasant people to deal with. All in all, 20 Hawley is nice but very expensive to live in, and I don’t believe that it is worth the money considering the issues I have mentioned. If they fix all of the things I have mentioned, then I would say it’s worth it, but until then I don’t think the price of living in Hawley is justified.",Noah
3 years ago,5,"20 Hawley has a wonderful maintenance worker, Steve, who has been extremely kind to my apartment when issues have arisen. Within half an hour of submitting a work order on my loud air system that was not producing heat, he knocked on my door and replaced the whole unit. Steve explained to us that he tries to keep the work order list from building up and works to fix them right as he receives requests. He is incredibly kind and personable whenever I see him. Multiple times at the beginning of the year I came across him late at night having to be called back in to work to help students that were locked out. Thank you for making 20 Hawley such a great place to live, and we appreciate all that you do Steve!",Edie Lindabury

6 years ago,2,"Lived here for over a year now and for the amount of money I've payed this apartment is not worth it. The staff is nice but not always as organized as possible. The fire alarm will go off on a nightly basis. The issues requiring maintenance for a resolution are far too common of a nuisance and all in all the competitors nearby seem to be leagues ahead and if I had another chance I'd happily pay the difference to stay somewhere else.

TL;DR Overpriced with constant issues resultant from spotty management and a building not remotely qualified to be called ""luxury""",Bjorn Van Hootenshire

7 years ago,5,"Signed the lease, but changed to other place because of few personal criteria.
Didn't live in it, but manager was friendly and easy to ask questions.
They gave me 3 days no charge lease cancellation, which made me much easier to
find different apartments suit my taste. It helped me find other apartments while not lose
my second best choice. Appreciated experience there.",woohwi joo
