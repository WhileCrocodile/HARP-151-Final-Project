6 months ago,5,"I recently signed a lease to live at the printing house next year and couldn't be more excited. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Not to mention the amenities are incredible. It's located in the downtown area, which makes going to restaurants very convenient. Overall, I couldn't be happier about my choice to live here!",Lauren Siegel
5 months ago,1,"Absolute scam. Attention all Binghamton students, please stay away from The Printing House. They won't show you the apartments before signing the lease on purpose, they look nothing like the model room. The Printing House refuses to fix prominent issues such as internet access, working elevators, for god sakes we went the entire year without a working thermostat. Furthermore, Printing House charges almost all students with delirious ""damage"" fees at the end of the year and hide behind the fat legal jargon in their lease to stronghold students into paying. Mr. Jeffrey Horowitz is as unprofessional as they get, and is the perfect smooth brained pawn for these hijo de p...s to scam college students. Negate all the five star reviews, those are just written by the office workers.",Joseph Banovic
a year ago,1,"We leased the apartment without actually seeing it because it is apparently not allowed. When leasing they promised each one of us a window. However, when I got here I saw that my one and only window was 3 inches away from a brick wall. Not an ounce of sunlight can get through. I have never felt more cheated, and I am extremely upset. I would never rent here again, and I would not ever recommend the printing house to anyone trying to find housing in Binghamton. It is a scam.",Korina Kesler
7 months ago,2,"Seems like a nice place to live however overall it is not worth it. Management ignores problems in the buildings no matter how many work orders you send. Only one elevator worked the whole year, and the working one made such horrifying noises as if it was going to free fall at any second. Took forever to fix it and endangered students lives. There was even a day where no elevators were working which is super unsafe and unfair for people with disabilities. All this and they will charge you a ridiculous amount of fees when you move out. My room was less than 100 square feet and I was charged 200 dollars for a ‚Äúwall repair‚Äù fee. Is paint that expensive? The pictures they used as ‚Äúproof‚Äù were blurry and showed nothing. Overall save your money and go somewhere else.",Melanie Turner
a month ago,5,"Great views on the top floors, clean and modern. Favorite part is the golfing simulator which is super cool!",Justin Mott
2 months ago,2,"Don't believe everything you see immediately. The rooms are smaller than expected. The rent is high. There's a lot of amenities which is nice, but management is not good. At least one of the elevators has been consistently broken for three months. Wifi sometimes goes down for full days at a time. I had to move a bunch of stuff out of my apartment down seven flights of stairs during winter break.",Tyler Gilbert
a year ago,1,"The printing house seems to be a great place to stay, until you actually live there. The wifi hardly works which makes it very difficult to do school work. The heat and air hardly work and you have practically no control. The windows let in the cold winter air which makes the room very uncomfortable. Everything is very poorly done from the backsplash in the kitchen to the ripped couch cushions to the bathroom with no fan. I am not impressed for the hefty price tag on the apartment. The walls are incredibly thin and you can hear everything from the tv, music, shower and voices in other apartments. The security guards don‚Äôt do anything other than grab packages. You also have to pay a separate fee for parking. I would not recommend for any young college students to live here. Don‚Äôt waste your money.",Erin O'Neill
a year ago,5,"Great place to live for college students! The Printing House is a safe, cost-effective, and convenient place to live. Living in this building is a lot safer than leasing a house or other apartment downtown. It is in a good neighborhood. Not only is it near the bus stop, if you do not have a car, it is a walking distance to every hot spot Downtown. Also, the Printing House has many benefits included to make leasing easier for college students. The staff is also very reliable and friendly. I would highly recommend the Printing House to anyone looking for a place Downtown, but especially for college students!",Christina Coulton
6 months ago,5,"I really like printing house because i think the rooms are nice, the layout of the apartments are great, and the amenities are so useful that I feel like I never need to leave the complex.",Lara Marks
a year ago,5,"I recently signed a lease to live at The Printing House this upcoming fall, and I am so excited! The place is incredibly clean, spacious, and the amenities are amazing. It is also just an overall beautiful complex! When I went for a tour, the leasing agent was very friendly, knowledgable, and seemed very eager to help with any questions I had.",Sarah Tartell
a year ago,4,"I am happy to be living in this apartment next year because it is safe, clean and is the perfect location to live for college students. It is 10 minutes away from Binghamton University campus. The gym is also very nice and the workers are very understanding and helpful.",Daniela Iloulian
a year ago,5,"Hands down the best place to live at in Downtown Binghamton. Best part is that its affordable and my parents feel much more safer that im staying at the printing house. Twinriver, Ulofts, and Hawley were way out of my price range. The printing house Has everything that you need and the amenities are awesome and there are lot of them. I have been staying here for 2020-2021 school year and just renewed my lease for 2021-2022 school yearüíØ. Amazing staff and management. They are always available if you have any type of problem and make sure you are satisfied with all the services that the printing house offers. Looking forward to another year!",Mohammad Haseeb
6 years ago,5,"My first year living at the printing house has been awesome. The staff and security guards are very receptive to any concerns and are always very friendly. The rooms are spacious and fully furnished. One of my favorite aspects about the Printing House is the location, it is one of the closest apartment buildings to State St. and in walking distance of numerous restaurants and places to go!",Victoria Weir
6 years ago,5,"I absolutely love The Printing House! The building is stunning and the units are so spacious and beautiful. The finishes are so trendy and modern, I can't believe that I am going to live in such an upscale apartment! The staff is so nice, they've answered every question and even spent time on the phone with my parents to reassure them on any concerns. One of the biggest selling points for me was the safety aspect: The Printing House has a security officer at the front desk 24/7. None of the other student apartments offer a security officer 24/7! I am so happy that I signed with The Printing House, I can't imagine living anywhere else!",Morgan Manganello
2 years ago,5,"I just signed my lease for 2021-2022 and am excited to start a new lifestyle living off campus. The lease was easy to fill out and communicating with the property manager was accessible for help. Touring the place went smoothly as well, we got see the sample sized apartments which gave a great perspective on how we can prepare for when move in time comes. I am excited to spend the next year at Printing House!",Carmen Foo
4 years ago,5,"I signed with the Printing House after searching for an affordable downtown housing option. The prices were very competitive and every room I've visited in each of their buildings was very clean and well taken care of. They are well furnished and stand out among the other downtown housing options. The Printing House is also located right next to some of the popular bars and restaurants. Any service request, question, or need from management/service was responded to immediately and professionally and I would definitely recommend the apartments to any prospective student or young professional.",Peter Schumejda
4 years ago,5,"I signed my lease at The Printing House August 2018. With the fall semester just about to start the leasing manager was still able to find me a room to not only live in but did everything he could to ensure I was satisfied with my room space. I love living here and it is one  of the best decisions I've ever made. The amenities are outstanding and staff here are welcoming , they make me feel safe. The area is also safe and convenient for college students who don't drive. You will be able to get a bus that'll take you everywhere. The Printing House sets college students up for adult living in the future. It gives you a sense of independency. Sign your lease today!",fatima holder
4 years ago,5,"I'm currently finishing up my lease at the Printing House for the 2017-2018 school year. I first signed when looking for an affordable downtown housing option and after looking at the model-room and the way each apartment was setup, my roommate and I instantly signed our two bedroom, two bathroom apartment. Spacious, enough natural lighting and a full size kitchen was perfect for us. Parking is close-by and the staff is very courteous.",Tara Dulak
4 years ago,4,"The Printing House has been a satisfying living experience and my roommate and I decided to live here again next year. The security is top notch and leaves me feeling safe without any worries which I can't say for many other apartment communities in the downtown Binghamton area. There are so many restaurants and shops within walking distance that make social life convenient. Noel on the leasing staff has been exceptionally welcoming and helpful, always answering any questions or concerns immediately, as well as being a friendly face who always wants to ensure the residents are comfortable and happy in their living community.",Megan Reilly
a year ago,5,The maintenance staff at The Printing House is incredible. They did a phenomenal job getting my son's apartment ready for an early move in date. Best residential building in Binghamton by far. Thanks guys!!!,Laura Homler
5 years ago,5,"The Printing house has been amazing to live in. They give you everything you need to live comfortably. The rooms are all fully furnished and they lend you a tv as well in the living room. The lobby is pretty nice and the basement is amazing. I have been using the basketball court a lot. Just today I got shipping labels printed in the computer lab so that I could return a box from Amazon. Speaking of packages, they notify you promptly as well when your packages come in. They also leave it in a secure spot for when you pick it up. All in all, this place is great. I'd highly recommend it to people looking for a place to live.",Mawuli Allorbi
3 years ago,5,"Printing house has been a great place to live for my roommate and I! The gym access was one of my favorites because who likes leaving home now a days once you‚Äôre in from class! The apartment wasn‚Äôt too big but it wasn‚Äôt small, just perfect for the two of us! Very close to food places, night life and so much more! The staff was always so pleasant and the Manager on site there Jeff was always super helpful no matter how big or small my problem was, he was sure to resolve it efficiently and always with a smile!! Thank you Jeff & Staff for making renting a bit easier for students!",Aldina Toric
2 years ago,5,I just signed my lease for the printing house a few weeks ago. Tao was my tour guide and was very helpful and informative. The central location and amenities for the price make it the best place to live for students. My favorite part about the printing house was definitely the basement area that had lots of study areas.,Danielle Testani
2 years ago,5,"I have lived in the Printing House for the past 2 years. The entire staff  members are pleasant and caring. Megan, Jake and Mark, go beyond and above to help. The maintenance crew keep the building, amenities, and common areas clean and very well maintained.  The location is excellent. I am happy to call the Printing House home.",Lodium Extra
3 years ago,5,My daughter had an amazing experience at the Printing House. She loved her apartment which was roomy and well-equipped. The building and location are perfect. She decided to study abroad for a semester and the staff were very accommodating and helped her to sublet her room quickly.  it could not have been a better experience all around. Thank you Jeff Horowitz for all of your assistance!,Jill Zilker
4 years ago,5,"The location is perfect and the rooms have incredible views of the city. The staff is friendly and helpful and they made the leasing process very easy for me. The pricing is better than any of the other apartment complexes downtown, but their amenities are on par with everyone else. I was super impressed by their security and study area. I'm really excited to live here next year!",Julia Sullivan
2 years ago,5,"My sister was the one who initially wanted to live off campus and I was a little skeptical at first but as soon as I stepped out from my tour of The Printing House I knew I had to live there and get off campus. You definitely get more bang for your buck compared to living on campus. The amenities like free laundry right in the building, a movie theatre, study pods, and a cycling room just to name a few blew me away. The Printing House is in the best area in Binghamton for restaurants and hang out spots. The BC Junction where the bus depot is and buses to go on campus are, is literally 5 minutes away. You can't get anymore convenient than that. Plus if you drive, there is a parking lot. I can go on and on about how much I loved The Printing House. Also shoutout to Emily for doing my tour and all the helpful and kind staff I have interacted with.",Atira Peterson
4 years ago,5,"Finding housing off campus in Binghamton was not hard at all once I found the Printing House! The facilities are beautiful and make you feel really comfortable. Not only is it located close to great restaurants and shops but it has everything you need inside. The fitness center, laundry room, study areas, and movie theater are all added bonuses to the gorgeous living spaces! So excited to live here!",Noelle Summo
3 years ago,5,"While we were a little nervous about our son moving off campus and into his first apartment,our fears went away on our first visit and move in day at the Printing House.We were immediately impressed with the overall security and professionalism of everyone we came in contact with.I was actually a little jealous of the accommodations.
It was also nice having management available and on top of any minor issues that came up.We  had piece of mind knowing our son was in good hands.Some of the off campus private housing was a little sketchy.
My son and his roommate really enjoyed all of the perks that came along with their stay.Our next child is applying to Binghamton and when he is ready he will be moving into the Printing House!",Robert Rudolph
6 years ago,5,"As soon as I entered the Printing House, I immediately fell in love with it! So many amenities included and modern furniture/outlook and it's the perfect location for me! The bus stops are right around the corner to take me to campus, which is very convenient for me because I do not own a car. There is a gym right downstairs- very convenient and essential. Most importantly, there is a guard 24/7 and that made both my parents and I feel very comfortable because many other off-campus housings do not offer that. The staff is extremely welcoming and answered all questions that both my parents and I had. Fortunately, I will be living there next semester with my two best friends and I am super excited; couldn't live anywhere else!",sahira Younas
3 years ago,5,The Printing House is a great choice for students living off-campus in Binghamton. The view of the city is great and the rooms are beautiful with up to date amenities and appliances. The tour we received was amazing and the guide sold us on the price point very well. Can't wait to live here next semester!,Sarah Shatla
2 years ago,5,"This past fall, I signed my lease with the Printing House. My tour guide Tao was super informative and helped me and my group picture ourselves at the Printing House. The great location, amenities, and especially the security measures were super appealing to both my parents and I as a college student. My favorite part of the Printing House was the huge basement area filled with various recreational facilities and study areas.",Madelyn Collett-O'Brien
5 years ago,5,"Lived here for a year. The 1st year it opened as Student Housing. The room sizes are nice and the living rooms are well furnished. They still improving the building , which is a good thing. Lot of events happen in the basement , but honestly it's food that interested me :P Do check out the lobby for free food :P they have something often. They have a good maintenance team and security team. Feel free to make friends with them , they are nice and friendly staffs. The location is pretty good , especially since Colonial , Alexander's , State St , Grey Hound bus stops are near by. They have a gym and lot of games at basement , the gym is not big , but can get the job done. They recently added Xbox and PS4 in the basement. It's not that the building has no problem , but the team is dedicated in resolving them , which is great.",Ananda Krishnan
a year ago,5,The leasing process was confusing at times but Catherine was very helpful in getting through it. My lease starts in August and I can‚Äôt wait to start living here. I have a few friends living here and have only heard good things,Gavin Suwara
4 years ago,5,The tour I took at Printing House was both remarkable and informative! The property is beautiful with awesome amenities. What stuck out most about this place was the kind and accommodating staff. I am excited to live her next year and am looking forward to making it my home.,Alexis Chase
5 years ago,5,"We recently moved our daughter into this building after two years of overpriced campus housing.  The unit beautiful but more importantly, Jeff is quite possibly the most accommodating and responsive person one could deal with.... he is reason enough to consider this facility over and above anything else in the area.  His staff is also exceptional and although they are college students themselves, they truly understand professionalism and service.   I would recommend this as a first class option to anyone looking for housing in the area...student or otherwise.",A S
5 years ago,5,"My daughter has been a resident at Printing House since August , 2016.  She just completed her junior year at Binghamton.  When she mentioned that she wanted to move off-campus to the Printing House after her sophomore year, I was very concerned.  She told me about all the amenities that the property would have for students, such as each resident having their own bedroom AND private bath, the health studio, basketball court, movie room, state-of-the-art laundry facilities, and more!  I must admit, I was intrigued!   After seeing the plans and lots of pictures, we agreed to let her sign a lease to move in with a group of her friends into a very spacious apartment.

We moved her in at the beginning of August last year.  We arrived at the office to sign all of the paperwork, and that was when I got to meet the General Manager of the Printing House, Jeffrey Horowitz.  I had a list (A LOT!!!) of questions, and he could not have been more patient or kind to me.  He spent as much time as necessary to give me all of the information that we needed for getting everything squared away.  He then offered to take all of us on a tour of the entire property, and we were pleased to take advantage of his offer to see this new and lovely property!

Once in the apartment, we were asked to complete a punch list of anything that wasn't up to standard (remember, this was brand new construction...final touches were still being attended to when we were on premises) and he would make sure all was taken care of...and it was!

Any time my daughter or any of her roommates needed to reach out to
Jeffrey with a service request, it was always handled professionally and quickly!  Jeffrey created a wonderful community there, and made sure that all residents were considerate of their neighbors, and he was always considerate to them, willing to listen, and treating them with respect and care.

In short, for our daughter, and for us, the Printing House has been a wonderful experience.  It ticked off all of our requirements:  safe, clean, affordable, comfortable, close to campus, with a very caring manager and team on site.  She has really loved living there.  With covered, and very well lit parking, at a very reasonable monthly rate, adjacent to the property, it made even snowy days manageable!

If you are seeking off-campus housing that gives you a huge bang for your buck (pretty awesome compared to my college housing!!), please give the Printing House your serious consideration.  You won't be disappointed!

A Happy and Satisfied Mom",Amy Anderson
4 years ago,5,"I'm excited to live in the Printing House for a second year because the amenities are great and the location is unbeatable. The Printing House offers multiple study locations, a newly renovated theater, and even a golf simulator. The building is within walking distance to all of Binghamton's best restaurants, nightlife, and transportation. The building is one of the most historic and notable in downtown Binghamton. Each unit features newly renovated private rooms with private bathrooms and a modern kitchen and spacious living room area. The Printing House is a great option for student living in Binghamton and I am very excited to live here again!",Claudia Miller
4 years ago,5,"I have been living at Printing House for 3 months now and honestly I really do feel at home here ! I live in a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom, and I share a bathroom with one of my roommates, which honestly has been working out great for us since there are 2 separate sinks with great storage.The whole place is an open concept and feels modern yet cozy, which can be hard to achieve in a smaller apartment.

I already resigned my lease to live here again next semester because the positives of living here really outweigh any negatives. The 24/7 security gives me a peace of mind when I hear stories of my friends' apartments and houses getting broken into, the fact that there are 2 elevators that run quickly make living on a higher floor so much easier, the fact that there is a parking garage directly behind the building lets me access my car very quickly in the cold weather, and if buses are necessary, the city and greyhound bus stations are around the corner! Mail is also super convenient, you get notified when a package comes and you pick it up right at the front desk.

The only negative I could think of is the fact that all of the other apartment communities have in-apartment laundry machines while we have to take the elevator down to the lobby, to take another elevator down to the basement, walk down a long hallway, to get to the laundry room which is frequently messy and smelly due to the buildup in the machines. I am someone who likes to do laundry frequently so not going to lie, this is a hassle that I wish I was able to avoid.

Other than the laundry situation, I really cannot think of any other reason as to why I don't love living here, and am looking forward to continuing living here for the rest of my time at Binghamton University!",Zuzia Krawczyk
5 years ago,5,"The rooms at Printing House are all fully furnished with a nice TV and full kitchen. The location is in the heart of Binghamton, really close to the bars so it's convenient to go out on the weekends. There's a lot of great restaurants that are around the neighborhood as well. All in all, I'd highly recommend it to people looking for a place to live.",Annie Yu
4 years ago,5,"The printing house has been my home for over a year and a half and it has everything i need! The fitness spaces, private bathroom in my double apartment, and beautiful kitchen are exactly what I was looking for in an apartment. As a bonus, the staff is always very friendly and accommodating.",Ashley S
6 years ago,5,The Printing House does a really good job accommodating with the tenants needs. The rooms are spacious and with nice new appliances.  Excellent floor plan and plenty of amenities. So happy I signed.,Kyle St. Clair
4 years ago,5,"I will be living here next fall year. Me , along with my 5 future roomates are very excited to live in a 6 person apartment. We each get our own bedroom and bathroom plus an extra bathroom in the living room which is very nice!!! Everything is furnished and a tv is given to us also. I am also very excited for the amenities provided (tanning beds, movie theatre room, basketball court). We took a tour of the building and our tour guide did a wonderful job of answering all questions and showing every aspect of the place.I look forward to moving in next year!!!",Christina Roth
4 years ago,5,"I'm excited to live here next year! The tour was amazing and informative. There are so many amenities. A great value for what you get. Also, the leasing process what relatively easy. Close to bars and buses.",Abbey Fenner
4 years ago,5,"I am super excited to be living in the Printing House! They offer a variety of amenities and are conveniently located by all the hot spots in downtown Binghamton.

3 years ago,5,"The printing house is the best place to live for any BU student lookin for live off campus... the staff is super friendly, the building is very well done with a ton of awesome amenities and features, and the price point is very reasonable!

3 years ago,5,What a great off campus apartment.  Jeff the manager gave us a great overview of the property.  Beautiful apartments with plenty of space.  Perfect location.  Walking distance to revitalized downtown Binghmaton including great restaurants and art galleries.  Very excited.,Green Environment parks100
3 years ago,4,"I had to fix my online lease, and customer service was readily reachable and willing to help. My tour of the Printing House was also satisfying and I was able to tour both the amazing selection of amenities including the mini theater and basketball court AND an actual apartment room to serve as reference (shoutout to my tour guide Carisa). Overall, I'm super excited to be living at the Printing House and have my own room!",Wenting Li
2 years ago,1,"I lived here during the 2019-2020 school year and I would not recommend living here after dealing with Printing‚Äôs management. You might notice that some of their reviews are from people who are excited to live there. This is because they inflate their reviews by telling students that have signed their leases for the NEXT year to ‚ÄúGoogle the Printing House and leave a positive review‚Äù in order to enter into a raffle for a month of free rent. You can‚Äôt blame students for taking advantage of this, but it speaks volumes about the building‚Äôs management. Not to mention, this violates Google‚Äôs review policy which states ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt...selectively solicit positive reviews from customers.‚Äù
Printing‚Äôs management also overcharges its renters for damages after they move out. When renters move in, they are given a sheet to record the condition of the apartment. Make sure to literally write down EVERY imperfection, ranging from any painted over walls, chipped paint and stained carpets. Printing‚Äôs apartments definitely aren‚Äôt brand new, but for some reason they pretend they are and charge their tenants. Most college students that come from on-campus living will simply accept the apartment as-is since ResLife isn‚Äôt even that nitpicky and just quickly fill out the form to get it over with. DON‚ÄôT DO THIS. Printing will nickel and dime you for ‚Äúdamages‚Äù even if they were already there and refer to your move-in sheet as evidence. Based on my experience, Printing will gladly charge first and ask questions later. It‚Äôs a shame that they clearly want to refurnish their properties by taking advantage of students.
For these reasons, I would recommend any student that is looking for downtown housing to look towards other options like Twin River, Hawley or Chenango Place. While the building itself isn‚Äôt horrible to live in, I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to have to go through the same experience I did. If you do decide to sign with Printing, be extremely detailed when filling out the move-in sheet and good luck dealing with them once your lease is up.",Andrew Chin
5 years ago,5,"The moment that we entered the building, we felt right at home. We were immediatley greeted with handshakes and smiling faces. The Management Team is very kind, and ready to help. Having a security guard at the entrance of the building, eased my worry about living somewhere unsafe. I believe that the location is exceptional, and that the amenities are very tough to beat. I am looking very forward to meeting new people, as well as exploring all that there is to offer here. This is a wonderful opportunity - There is no doubt that we have made an excellent choice on where we get to call home!",Alexxis Ector
4 years ago,5,I have toured Twice. I have signed the 2019-2020 lease and will move in next year. The Printing House is very elegant. It's very new and has a lots of recreational facilities. It's very close to downtown so it's a good place to live.,Xueqing Du

5 years ago,5,"As a parent of a Binghamton Student, the Printing House Apts are by far the best choice for off campus housing. The manager Jeff is super professional and always responsive (although there were no issues)
My son rented a one bedroom apt., and will be back next year. Thank you Printing House for making this experience a stress free year!",Sandra Juan
5 years ago,5,"Great experience living here, everyone is so friendly and kind. Security guards are hilarious and the building is beautiful. Any problems I had were taking care of quickly. In my opinion it is the best student apartment complex in binghamton!!",Ava Salvatore
4 years ago,5,The building is beautiful and the staff is always willing to help with any problem you may be facing. The amenities give it a luxurious vibe. Noel is always pleasant to talk to and he goes out of his way to accommodate all your needs. This is my first year living here and I can‚Äôt wait to be coming back next year as well!,Chloe LaCorazza
6 years ago,5,"We signed a lease site unseen and dealt with Jeff who runs the building.  Jeff was really great to deal with and really helped address any concerns we had when not actually seeing a place in person prior to signing up. When we saw the unit we were very happy, beautiful appliances, very nice furniture, etc. Also any issues we have had Jeff was always very fast to respond to and I felt he really went out of his way to make sure we were happy with everything.",Alan F
6 years ago,4,"I am moving into the printing house next semester, but after visiting it I love it. The location is very convenient (downtown by the bars and food) and they have also added a bunch of new amenities. The Printing House is also very clean and the staff is very welcoming.",Jonathan Goncher
6 years ago,5,I moved into the Printing House Fall 2016 and have enjoyed my experience so far. When I first moved in there were a few problems but the staff was very receptive and fixed the problems in a timely manner. The room sizes are nice and you can't beat the location. I definitely recommend!,Megan hart
4 years ago,5,"I absolutely love the printing house for its great location, security, and amenities.  Everything about the printing house is beautiful and the staff respond quickly and professionally. So excited to spend my 20019-2020 school year in such great housing.",Priya Perez
4 years ago,1,"Definitely the worst student housing in all of Binghamton. Paid almost $900 a month per room for a thee bedroom apartment while none of their amenities worked all year. Fire alarms go off all the time in the middle of the night. You are also forced to pay rent for the entire month of August even they only allow you to move in the last week of the month. Management also makes you pay to get into your room if your'e locked out more than one time but is allowed to enter your room even when you are not there which is ridiculous. If I could go back in time and live anywhere else, I would.",Clarissa Mejia
4 years ago,2,"Update: the staff are very friendly but not proactive at all! Have leaking issue for a month and they only temporarily ‚Äúfixed‚Äù it by putting a bucket on the roof to hold water. And they dont tell you the progress unless you approach to them first
Have this water problem living without hot water for four days then when it‚Äôs finally fixed it broke again completely after 6hours. The whole building has no water to use, cannot shower, brush teeth, flush toilet, nothing.
Also, I lived here last year too and their lease ends on 7/31 and the new one doesn't start until 8/17. They charge you $450 if you want to stay in for the period in between otherwise you have to move out and move in after. This is ridiculous.
Overall the people working there are nice, but for $1000 a month in a little town, it could've been better.",Kishi Qiang
3 years ago,1,"If you like sleep I would not recommend Printing House at all, the fire alarm is always going off late at night especially when I have a test the next day. Tremendously loud alarms for false measures that happens so much it is considered a pattern at this point rather than and occurrence every now and then.

Update: I have moved out since my last review and I have a balance of $500 somehow. ABSOLUTELY ABSURD! Strongly do not recommend.",Isaam Abdul
6 years ago,5,"The general manager was helpful and receptive to all of my questions. Signing a lease was an easy experience here.
And the space here is great! Such an upgrade from the campus dorm rooms. The whole suite, bathroom and layout, is wonderful.",Adeenah Ahmed
5 years ago,1,"Absolutely the worst housing experience I could have had. They lied about the completion date of the building and postponed the move-in date but still charged the full monthly price last year. They also required everyone to purchase an insurance right before move-in date which was never mentioned during leasing. Whoever works in the corporate is so dumb that she couldn't figure out the online payment problem that I had, and all she could say is because my card is an international VISA, which worked perfectly fine later that day. The Loft pic on the top of facebook page is absolutely fake. I've moved twice so far and every room is much smaller than what's advertised, and do not expect to get fresh air anywhere from 1st - 5th floor cuz if you open the window there is literally a wall in front of your face. For some rooms on the 1st floor, the windows are located almost 6 feet above you that you'd never be able to even open them. The building constantly has the smell of drugs and the loud musics, and on the leasing policy it clearly says NO PET & NO SMOKING, but people do all kinds of drugs and bring their dogs with them everywhere in the building anyway.
If you are looking for an off campus student housing, go to U club. If you can't find a room there, go to Twin River. If Printing House is your only option, avoid 1st - 5th floor or Building 21. Avoid random roommate cuz you could possibly get the worst roommate you'll ever have. Also, try to negotiate for a lower price cuz everyone is paying different monthly rent, and they do take advantage of BU students, mostly internationals.",Uhsnahc Uoy
5 years ago,4,When I first moved into the Printing House I was very impressed with the small details from the granite countertops to the tiles in the tub/shower. The location is much better than that of some of the other popular complexes downtown and the amenities are exactly what I need as a student.,Ashley Sarlanis
3 years ago,5,"My daughter lives in the Printing House in Binghamton and I visited her a couple of weeks ago in her beautiful 11th floor apartment with amazing views of the city. I noticed that the windows were marred by pigeon waste, which somewhat took away from the view- I emailed asking for the windows to be cleaned. This was taken care of the VERY NEXT DAY by Mark, the maintenance supervisor. Thank you very much Mark!!! This was a great response and excellent service!!",Judy Plotkin
6 years ago,5,"Printing House is such a great living option in the downtown Binghamton area. It is newly renovated and very sleek and modern. I believe printing house just opened for living this past fall semester which means that it and all the furniture is brand new. If you compare printing house to other living arrangements in the area, such as Hawley, Twin, and Ulofts, Printing House has the best prices for new furniture and new amenities. I would definitely choose PH out of the 3.",Joanna Eng

3 years ago,1,"This is the 7th day in a row that the fire alarms have gone off now. These alarms are ear piercing and has an automated voice that yells for people to evacuate the building. This happens all day and at all hours of the night. Do not recommend this place for anyone trying to live an ordinary life and not be disrupted by having to deal with these alarms and evacuating constantly. They go off so often the fire department doesn‚Äôt even come anymore. Vaery dissappointed overall, not what it seems.",Alexandra Batista
